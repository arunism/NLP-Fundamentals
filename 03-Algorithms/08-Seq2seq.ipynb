This will turn dropout (and batch normalization) off. We use the `torch.no_grad()` block to ensure no gradients are calculated within the block. This reduces memory consumption and speeds things up. The iteration loop is similar to the training loop except the fact that we are not updaing parameters and teacher forcing is also turned off. This will cause the model to only use it's own predictions to make further predictions within a sentence, which mirrors how it would be used in deployment."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":15,"status":"ok","timestamp":1674644745122,"user":{"displayName":"Arun Ghimire","userId":"12379322823635086573"},"user_tz":-345},"id":"cwWu1ujfRI34"},"outputs":[],"source":["def evaluate(model, dataloader, criterion):\n","    model.eval()\n","    epoch_loss = 0\n","    batch_idx = 0\n","    with torch.no_grad():\n","        for src, tgt in dataloader:\n","            src = src.to(device)  # [len(src), batch_size]\n","            tgt = tgt.to(device)  # [len(tgt), batch_size]\n","            output = model(src, tgt, 0)  # Teacher forcing is turned off\n","            output_dim = output.shape[-1]\n","            output = output[1:].view(-1, output_dim)  # [(len(tgt) - 1) * batch size, output_dim]\n","            tgt = tgt[1:].view(-1)  # Shape = [(len(tgt) - 1) * batch size]\n","            loss = criterion(output, tgt)\n","            epoch_loss += loss.item()\n","            batch_idx += 1\n","    return epoch_loss / batch_idx"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wms-pHAiRI35"},"source":["Let's create a function to track the time taken by each epoch during the training process."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":22,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":14,"status":"ok","timestamp":1674644745122,"user":{"displayName":"Arun Ghimire","userId":"12379322823635086573"},"user_tz":-345},"id":"iFsyj5bFRI35"},"outputs":[],"source":["def epoch_time(start_time, end_time):\n","    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time\n","    elapsed_mins = int(elapsed_time / 60)\n","    elapsed_secs = int(elapsed_time - (elapsed_mins * 60))\n","    return elapsed_mins, elapsed_secs"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3JuQHIVyRI35"},"source":["Finally, its training time.
