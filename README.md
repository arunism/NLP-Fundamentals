# NLP Fundamentals

Implementation of different Natural Language Processing concepts
to enhance learnings from the basics to the advanced concepts of NLP.

`What is NLP?` Natural Language Processing or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of
natural language, like speech and text, by software. For detailed information about NLP, you may find [this
article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/natural-language-processing/) useful.

## Requirements

The program works well with python version >=3.8.0.
All the other required packages are mentioned alongside their respective demos.

`Make sure` the requirements mentioned here are satisfied, or the result may not be as expected.
