    "In NLP an independent text entity is known as document and the collection of all these documents over the project space is known as corpus. TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. The entire technique can be studied by studying _TF_ and _IDF_ separately.\n",

    "2. Rare in the corpus but frequent in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this TF-IDF score is used as a value for each shell of the document-term matrix, just like the frequency of words in case of Bag-of-Words. The formula below is used to compute TF-IDF score for each shell:\n",
