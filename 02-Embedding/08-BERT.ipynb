    "BERT, as its name stands for, builds a bidirectional transformer-based language model using encoders rather than decoders. BERT is a state-of-the-art transformer architecture developed by `Google`. BERT is built on top of several popular ideas like [Semi-supervised Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01432), [ELMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365), [ULM-FiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146), [OpenAI Transformer](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) and [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).\n",

    "For fine-tuning and pre-training for different downstream tasks like Q/A, Classification, Language Modelling, Multiple Choice, NER etc. different layers of the BERT are used.\n",

    "- BERT can be used to extract features (word and sentence embeddings) from text. These features can be useful for keyword/search expansion, semantic search and information retrieval even if thereâ€™s no keyword or phrase overlap.\n",
    "- BERT can be used to fine-tune downstream models. The pretrained features can be used as high quality feature inputs to these downstream models."
