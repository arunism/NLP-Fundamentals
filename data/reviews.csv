64220,"If you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew Ng course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary ML framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignments don't help you develop the knowledge required for ML developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience.",1

62961,"I was not impressed. (And not impressed with this automatically centered text box either.) There was far too much very technical detail that no one save those working for hedge fund developers would ever use. The volume of analysis they suggest is overwhelming and impossible for the average investor, and when all is said and done, worthless. The market moves on news, rumors, scandal, etc; think Enron, Worldcom, Texaco, et al. None of the concepts presented in this course would have prevented you from investing in those companies when they were beginning or in their prime.I'm about to become a registered investment advisor. I took this course looking for ideas to improve my recommendations. No go. This was terrible.In addition, the presentation was presented by automatons I think. They rarely looked at us, they read flatly from the prompter. A good text to speech program could easily have replaced the ""teachers"".",1

39444,"I really wouldn't call this a course, just an overview of VR & AR technologies and really general principle of work for AR. It took be less than an hour to watch everything and pass the tests.",1
5551,"Very bad course. The content can barely be applied outside US, you don't know from which perspective it's explained (for sales or purchasing people), the videos are bad quality, the teacher is babbling, no extra resources, no interaction with the audience outside the assessments.",1

51169,"I wrote some indepth feedback, but par for the course, I can't save it - either here or on the discussion board. Nothing obscene, but certainly some major frustration with format, inconsistencies in scoring and format, information not reviewed in the course on some of the quizzes, the fact that Coursera keeps trying to sell me the specialty, the lack of ANY moderator on the discussion board to provide assistance...and can go on with the technical issues to but I won't!",1
85588,"I was very excited by the topic of this course, but quite disappointed when I finally started it.The content of this course has little to do with its promising title.In fact. the content lacks any coherency. There is no logical development of the course content - it's all disconnected facts told one after another.Another factor is the delivery. I know the teachers are Italians & English is not their first language and that is fine. But they are just reading out the content - that's all. They are just passively reading the content from somewhere so it is hard to concentrate because the interactivity value is zero and their accent takes some time to get used to.Both content and delivery of this course were disappointing even though I was (and am) really, really interested in this topic.",1
9983,"Again a course that comes with very simple (and not always good prepared) video lectures but for recieving a grade an enormous math knowledge is necessary, with no further help given",1

4348,"This is an advanced Statistics class. Learning was chaotic, confusing, and fast paced. Strong Mathematics skills required. As icing on the cake, there is an 8 hour project at the end of the course .. and they only tell you at the end that you should have been working on this all along! Not at all what I wanted to learn or find productive in the real world.",1
73241,Very American perspective.,1
98333,"Although the content is good, the course itself does not reflect in any way what a good asynchronous course should be. Where is the discussion board? How can one communicate with the instructor or with other classmates? Although peer review of an assignment is one aspect of asynchronous and synchronous education, said assignment should also be reviewed by an instructor, especially when said instruction carries so much weight. In addition, I think overall the tests are unfair. I was marked wrong twice for a question that asked my opinion! Also, in the ""check all that apply"" questions, if one misses one of the answers, the whole question is marked wrong. Finally, many of the test questions themselves are irrelevant to the content of the course. One last thing- the course says it's a five week program, but there are only 4 weeks. Something needs to be adjusted.",1

25125,"The cloud computing service with amazon described in the course is not free anymore. I was charged money for using it. The course also took much more time to complete than I wanted to spend. I believe a better design of the project could lead to a more efficient, less frustrating learning experience. Details below.The usegalaxy server was extremely slow. As shown in the course, I installed an instance of galaxy in the AWS/Amazon Cloud. I was under the impression that this was a free service for the first year. Amazon has changed its interfaces and I could not do the installation as recommended. But I managed to run a few analyses with some workarounds. I did not explicitely terminated the galaxy instance for ~ 6 days. Charges of $280 accumulated.The course project in week 4 was far beyond what was covered in the lectures. It took me a whole week, spending multiple hours every day. Many dead-end roads coupled with extremely long run times on the galaxy servers resulted in very inefficient learning and many frustrations. Help via the discussion forum was critical to design an analysis pipeline - so thank you Dejan and all contributors for the support.This is not a course I could easily do part-time: I don’t have time to read the fine print on what is available for free on Amazon, nor do I have time to go through all of the tools on galaxy to find out what would be the best for my analysis.On the positive side: I think Galaxy is a great tool.",1
82805,"In fact, this is an inconsistent attempt of re-implementing previous FRP course from the same authors. FRP course had many issues about homework/lectures being poorly related, this one is even worse. This is very frustrating, as a topic itself is one of the most interesting ones in today's software engineering.",1
13493,To lock assignments for money is disgusting.,1
104003,"This course is poorly designed. What course on a programming language jumps first into how to use the debugger and what went wrong with a program? You are not introducing Swift, you are introducing xcode (and doing a terrible job of it). Also, I have been using xcode and Swift for 8 months now and producing some really good work, but I could only get 3/7 on your quiz because you have written questions with the purpose of tricking people instead of reinforcing or checking knowledge of the content.When you teach a new application, consider introducing the interface first. Explain what the various areas are, what they are needed for, and how to control them. This orients the user in the application and helps them to find their way around when they are trying to reinforce your teachings later.The presentation for this course is so unprofessional. It's like a running commentary on a movie instead of an educational presentation. I felt like I was listening to two geeks stuffing around and having a good time, instead of people who are professional teachers!I'm so incredibly disappointed with this course. Back to the wonderful work of Paul Hegarty from Stanford University on iTunes University and YouTube for me.University of Toronto - you should really consider what your teaching staff are doing before you unleash them on the world.",1
27354,Very bad or non-existent support,1
20795,no one would take this course any more.,1
98325,"I would have given this course NO stars at all if that option were available!!!The course is designed in contradiction of all the principles it preaches--there are no forums for the students, there is no way you could contact the instructor, the instructor keeps reading badly, stammering like a first-grader, speaks monotonously and there's no interaction whatsoever!Furthermore, there are mistakes in the quizzes and you have to choose blatantly wrong options if you want to get the 100% score!Although the subject matter about Virtual Instruction is pretty interesting and the instructor made it sound like the most boring thing in the world!Many of the links are outdated or not working at all and often the documents she refers to are 10 or more years old. Bear in mind that Virtual Instruction is a fast developing field and the technology as well as the legal framework are changing very fast too.In a nutshell, if this course were not a part of a Specialization track, I would not have paid for it.Unless you want to do the specialization, I wouldn't recommend this course or any by the UC Irvine because all of the lack forums and no channels for communication with the instructors!!!In one word BAD!",1
86253,very redundant and lacks diversity,1
41900,"This course was required by my director, but it is not for those who have no background in law (which was the case for the group of us at CDC who were required to take this). It was very difficult to iuinderstand and I did not think it was a ""beginner's course for no",1

I am a college instructor for Statistics, having graduated from a PhD program - even with that background I could not follow the instructor.The course designer never considered the audience, and never identified the goals of this course. The instructor was lost between teaching R and teaching stats, so in the end he did neither. Worst course I have ever taken, both online and face-to-face.",1

7786,"I am really disappointed with the content of this course. If what you're looking for is the most basic of information on making better choices and remembering to wash your cutting board after handling raw meat, maybe this course is for you. If, however, you come to this course wanting specific information about how to build great meals for babies, toddlers, and young children, or you'd like to know how their needs change over time, this course is not for you. I was hoping for information like how to teach your toddler to chew/eat difficult things (ex: whole apples). I wanted to know at what age/weight you switch to 2% milk. I wanted to know how many calories a meal should be based on height and weight and how that changes over time. I wanted to know medically verified tips on getting the right amount of each nutrient into a toddler's diet and what, if any, extra vitamins should be added. I wanted tips on weaning if you're still nursing a toddler... I guess I just wanted more.In addition, the quizzes are so easy as to be silly. Actual quiz question and correct answer: Which is NOT a good way to approach grocery shopping if healthy choices are desired? Answer: Visit the supermarket hungry and walk through the candy aisle first. COME ON! Did I need a Stanford University course to tell me that one?!?!?While the instructor is knowledgeable, this course is geared toward someone with NO knowledge, not someone who wants to gain a deeper understanding. The videos are painfully slow (am I waiting for a doodle here???) and I could read the entire course worth of transcripts in under a half hour rather than go through all of the videos. And the recipes... good god! I don't think that someone interested in learning more about child nutrition is needing a slow tutorial on how to make basic oatmeal on the stove top. If she'd upped the game- showed basics and then talked about the benefits of adding, say, chia seeds, different fruits, flax, etc. and how best to make a basic bowl of oatmeal into a complete breakfast, that would have been a useful topic.I'm just hugely disappointed. This course is best suited to perhaps a health department; not to someone seeking college level information about a topic that matters to their children's lives.",1
5552,This course offered nothing significant or new to anyone who has spent any time around business or government negotiations. It really seems as though the instructor either assumes all of her students are completely inept or that because it is a free course that producing a reasonably viable product is not necessary.,1
78511,"I am very disappointed with this programming course. The course lacks detail and deepth and could be taught in 45 to 60 minutes instead of 7 weeks. The quizzes and assignments were to easy and basic (solved in less than 5 minutes) and definitely not enough. Annoying was the overuse of colours in almost every video (almost everything was coloured - highlighting everything is just as usefull as highlighting nothing, green box with white text inside - did you try to read that on a different monitor than yours?), the pointless and useless doodles, smilies and whatsoever, wasting my time by watching you dispose your teabag/drinking tea or coffee/talking about your mug/etc., why do you even need to drink in a 20 minute-or-less video. The Tutor tried to loosen a dry topic. Mostly it wasn't my humor but I can live with that. I had hoped for more :(",1

The transcriptions into English are incomplete, so understand this course is very very complicated.I do not recommend it at all.",1
66736,"I was enrolled in the full specialisation and things went great for the 2 first courses i did, which were mostly peer-review-based (logistics & sourcing).With this one i gave up feeling really unassisted and unable to get answers to my feedback requests. no feedback is provided when you ask something in the forums, ever.When you flag a milestone because of technical issues you won't be ever answered (even when you upload screenshots as proof).The practical exercises with spreadsheets are poorly explained and even contradicted, especially as far as cutting and/or rounding integers are concerned. this is something that can prove 'costly' when doing the quizzes I failed all the questions of all the quizzes for all the attempts I tried. I'm not sure if this is coursera's fault or rutgers' but i don't think i will take ever another course (paying) here in coursera with these kind of calculation quizzes, it's a waste of time.I can't imagine how a mathematical or programming course must be with this poor approach of assessing the results. I suppose I will be censored if I explicitly mention similar sites to coursera but these kind of tests and quizzes are much more better addressed.In a nutshell, I subscribed to the full specialisation paying 45 EUR per month, the first month I was able to certificate myself with the 2 first I did ( logistics & sourcing), this second month (planning & operations) that has just started I gave up, so my final outcome is 2 certificates for 45 EUR each one.Tolerable but you'll never get me here again.",1
99673,"The qiuz are managed terribly, full of error and I seriously doubt the professor ever seen these quiz before. The Course suit for a beginner but a bit fragile, I expect more about building a usable model. This course need serious review.",1

72394,"Not recommended at all. She gets some things right, but really wastes the opportunity to drill the most fundamental and important point about philanthropy: namely, that the most important factor in assessing a non-profit's value is effectiveness, and non-profits vary in their effectiveness by many orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a small number of Charity Evaluators and Meta charities have identified those charities which most effectively address the most common values of aspiring philanthropists.I don't recommend this course for anyone.

83945,Too basic for programers,1
42066,"Well, while I felt really frustrated after having played ALL of this course videos, I have first put very negative comments here for its reviewing. I have then been kindly asked to reconsider my comments under the light of the usefulness of this course to some audience. For sure, it might be that I was not of the attended audience. And I still think that this course was of no interest to me - this is the reason why I'm still pleased not to have paid for its useless certificate. Nevertheless, this course might be of interest for some students. This is definitively true. So, let me suggest a new title for it: ""Design and Make Infographics for the Dummies"". Because that's it! This course is definitively perfect for the ones who know nothing about Infographics and they might enjoy it. Finally, I shall neither modify nor remove my previous comments on the examples used by the author.Please notice that Coursera still gets all my confidence about the usefulness and the quality of their proposed courses. For instance, just have a look to the course ""Machine Learning"" of one of its co-founders, Andrew Ng.------------------------------------My previous comments here below:For sure I was not the correct audience for this course. But nothing useful to be learned in here. Karl Gude is too much speaking of what he has formerly done, which is of only interest to him. I dislike the examples he uses : violence, sex, illness, accidents, weapons, war, drugs - and fruits, ok. Are these the only topics of interest to him? Finally, it appears that the $45 certificate does not worth it. I'm pleased not to have paid for it. And I definitively not recommend this course. Waste of time if not even waste of money.",1

67065,"This class was extremely disappointing. While the material is interesting and the mathematics and computer science are excellent, the format of the course makes substantive learning difficult. The crux of the course is based on lecture videos. Unfortunately, the videos amount to the professor simply reading off Powerpoint slides with occasional quizzes in the video. There are only 4 programming assignments, the first of which demanded a total of 2 new lines of code. Later assignments are more involved, but there are still only 4 of them. I for one only learn effectively when the class is engaging. That means slightly more dynamic lectures, more involved assignments. I don't learn or retain anything meaningful from powerpoints and multiple-choice quizzes, and I know that many agree. If you're the kind of person who can learn from reading a powerpoint slide, then you'll be fine. I got nothing out of this course.",1

67205,"The pedagogy in this course is truly horrible. It is severely lacking concrete relevant real world examples - in the beginning of each lecture would be super - motivating each technique. This is kind of a dealbreaker. Furthermore the material is REALLY dry and theoretical, lacking pragmatic problem solving. IMO way too much time and energy is wasted on history, name-dropping and dry mathematical backrounds. Andrew Ng of Stanford University, with his course ""Machine Learning"" is a great example of how it can and should be done.Suffice to say it would be much more smoth, fun and efficient to start with 1) current real world relevant problem(s) motivating the technique, then 2) a clear description of the technique - with concrete examples mapping the theory to practice. This last part is super important and is what is lacking the most in the course. One more thing, the quizes and questions makes alot of silent and weird assumptions, often not even clearly relating to the lecture materials.

The tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate only for a grade school level classroom--not something for working professionals.

Even if the goal were to teach those with no programming experience, it could accomplish that while providing more content, and making the content relevant.Is the course worth the price? Hell no. If you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end. The entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes. One would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.I'm not sure about the value of the videos titled ""Office Hours."" They all appeared as self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, ""hey look how great I am making this video in Paris."" They're really nothing more than that. In one video, he corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives the professor a polite brush-off: ""other people here would like to talk with me too."" After all of these videos, you will ask yourself, ""okay, why did Severance make me watch that?"" ""What was the point?"" And you'll shrug your shoulders and say, ""another waste of time.""",1
4234,"I´m quite disappointed in this course. First you should know that the first week doesn´t reflect at all the rest of the course in difficulty and in matter. As I was delighted by the first week presentation and way of explaining as soon I started the second week I was wondering what happen to the clear, concise examples and ideas presented in the first one. First The presentation of the following weeks is done by handwriting on software that give a very very poor graphic view. It´s BARELY READABLE ! It allows really smalls amounts of infos to be displayed. That could be redeemed by good explanations you may say but sadly it´s not the case most of the time. The examples are rarely connected to something real, numbers come up from ... nowhere. The level of difficulty could be challenging if you don´t have a bachelor of sciences like Math or Physics or Bio. It´s NOT A BEGINNER COURSE.To give more context I have done and succeed more 16 courses , 2 specializations, followed/audited about 3 others courses and that is the first time I´m giving a bad review. I´m sure the teachers put a lot of effort in doing the course , there is a lot subjects presented but I definitely suggest a change in the presentation to start then connect and fully explain examples. With some changes that course will fly high :)",1

93246,"A University Course should be a place where you advance your knowledge with a ""limited and reasonable"" amount of time spent in the course. The role of instructors should be to ""invest"" the time to provide the concepts and information for the students of the course to ""learn"" faster than if they had to research (the planet) by themselves to find the knowledge. The information provided by instructors therefore must be ""accurate and complete"". This course has so many ""incomplete"" pieces of information, that it requires insurmountable amounts of time to ""find"" the concepts required to apply the knowledge, hence it becomes a gigantic ""time waster"". Unfortunate! the tool and the concept of data science is necessary, but a course organized this way is only for ""full time students"" that have only one obligation, study.

It is OK to pay for the verified certificate, however, disabling the functions in the course is a wrong way to earn money, because people who want to learn the course might not necessarily want the certificate, and this is unfair to them because it limits the resources available. This whole Specialization thing starts to make me feel like you guys are in urgent need of money, rather benefiting the community.

Seriously, so boring!2) There is a high degree of subjectivity in grading essays (peer reviews)This course can benefit from:1) Clearer introduction of concepts using pictures and animations, as well as cutting out the repetitiveness (and the assault of the jargonaut)2) A better approach to grading that places importance on concepts instead of key words (jargon)",1

I was looking forward to taking the entire Ruby On Rails specialization, now I'm not so sure.",1
104932,"Content covered in this course was hard to learn, both because it was pitched at a level that realistically was more akin to a wrap up of content already covered (when in fact it was all new content) and because the instructor, Brian Caffo, has not a style that was conducive to teaching.The instructor often would launch into a topic, and then speed through a calculation with basically no explanation.In terms of time, this was one of the most intensive courses in the specialisation, and I'd recommend taking this course alone (not concurrently with other courses) for that very reason.",1
42234,"I've just wasted 2 hours going through repetitions of what I'll learn, but not actually learning anything.

Thank you very much!",1

88719,"I thought this was poor. It was basically a re-hash of the previous module with slightly different tasks.

104825,"I've not found this course organized pedagogically speaking. The organization, insofar as ""here is a list of stuff I'll be teaching"" makes sense. But a lot of the ""teaching"" is ill suited for someone looking to learn with a minimal statistical background. It's incredibly frustrating and disheartening.",1
88300,"the peer review was a waste of time, some individuals submit whatever other review whatever; I found that the assessment criteria is not based on evaluating the quality of performed work, and therefore have not really learned much from the capstone project. I am taking another course which as well has peer review, I am rethinking if it's worth it.... do not see any value, there is no real feedback from instructor. If I need it a peer review, I could just ask my colleagues at work.",1
24276,"As a person who actually studied physics and knows a little about data science, I am literally baffled the way information presented and lectures speak.

60531,"Rather uninteresting presentation. I found it hard to become interested in the course or Kierkegaard after having high hopes of truly enjoying it. The best parts of the lectures were when the instructor was taped at venues pertinent to the course. The peer reviewers were not always fair, in my opinion. I'd spend my time elsewhere, personally, especially since this course was something for my own personal edification and not a requirement.",1

I also had no kind of communication with instructors, TAs, or other student for help. It is ridiculous that there is NO feedback forums, and this seems to be the only course that handles it that way. If this an institutional decision to not have feedback, it seems that these instructors and/or the University of California, Irvine do not care to help students. I would not recommend this to anyone!",1

83548,"Instructor, Dr. Chuck, is terrific. However, assignments are incredibly difficult. You are supposed to spend no matter than a few hours a week on the course. I spent over 100 hours alone on the assignments. The mentors that are supposed to help you did not help at all. Very poorly put together second module that does not prepare you to complete the assignments",1
14563,"This should not be a course. It's just introduction and should be condensed to one video and a handout with pointers to those who need more specific and detailed instructions for setting up their computers. This is not a learning course. All they teach you how to install git, R and Rstudio. And they take money for this (if you want to say you ""completed"" the course)!!! Highly unethical practice in my opinion.The surveys are stupid too. They don't distinguish between those who completed (but not earned any credentials) and those who didn't.In my opinion this is a very dumbed down version of an introduction to a data science course (and not a cours in itself). Definitely not worth 4 weeks!A much more valuable course is Stanford's ""Machine Learning"" where you can actually learn something (and don't force you out of evaluation if you don't pay).",1
90155,"The topic is interesting and the lectures itself were good. The explanations of the algorithms and concepts was clear and easy to understand. However, the amount of material covered is very little. I think there should either be more concepts thought or they should be covered in more depth.Quizzes: The quizzes were very weak. They didn't really tell you weather you understood the concept or not. If one of the answers was wrong there was no information which one it was. So you have no idea which lecture you should watch again.Assignments: The assignments were very bad prepared. In some assignments there were bugs in the provided code, we weren't supposed to edit. The assignments itself are rather easy and can be completed quite quickly, if there wasn't the grader. From the grading you got no information what was wrong or which tests passed or failed. Most of the time it wasn't the case that the algorithm failed, instead the output was not as expected by the grader, although it was as described in the assignment. But you never knew. This part has to be improved a lot.Overall I have to say that I expected much more from University of Pennsylvania, especially after taking the first part of the Specialization which was of good quality.",1
101111,"This course was terribly underwhelming. There is no interaction from the Wharton staff, nothing that connects this to anything learned in the specialization, and nothing that even resembles a case study. Grades are subjectively assigned on a very narrow grading scale by peers and the format of the assignment doesn't allow for enough explanation to develop a thesis. of Any information given to the student is from magazine/newspaper/journal articles without data and we are tasked with identifying a business solution to a problem with little context. Very disappointed in this offering. After taking the Data Analysis specialization offered through Duke University I know what a capstone course should be and this course is so far from that it should be removed from the course catalog.",1
7235,Not worth your time or money.,1

For the previous courses, I've always used the books and they helped me tremendously to be able to comprehend the material. There is a book for Regression Models but but it's a real mess. It feels like a draft that no one cared to take a second look. There is a bunch of wrong code and typos. The explanation doesn't go as far as it should. I had to resort to many different sources just to be able to get by the course. I hope the instructors review this course soon because it does not have the same quality as others. If they don't review it, don't bother paying for it. Try learning Regression Models elsewhere.",1
15899,"The assignments do not give you any practical methods for actual problem solving. They're just a succession of activities that pretend to be creative by making you do things ""you wouldn't normally do"". It's like they forgot the part about ""problem solving"".The assignments are to eat foods you've never eaten, talk to people you wouldn't normally talk to, take a photo of yourself smooching someone/something, and to ""give"" something to someone you ""never have given anything before"". That is not creative nor helpful at problem solving. It's just a series of activities for people who have too much time on their hand and need something to do to get out of their routine.Not a course I would recommend for anyone wanting to gain useful skills.",1
93869,"They don't give enough inputs and instructions to complete the assignments, unless they could offer addicional material.",1
103981,Basically a couple of guys have an unorganized discussion about swift. Little to no organization with poor coordination between lectures and quizzes..

5263,"Puerile, made up examples with made up data, no deeper treatment of the mathematics involved than the here-is-a-magic-formula-use-it approach and mistakes (including serious conceptual and factual errors) evident in the quizzes and the R labs. Far better to look out for the ""Data Analysis and Statistical Inference"" course by Duke on Coursera that is presented by a passionate statistics teacher, covers the same material (and more) and provides a far better introduction to R than this course.One of the stated purposes of this specialization is to clean up the way social scientists conduct science and are perceived as scientists; in this respect, it appears that the worst enemies of social scientists are social scientists.",1
4407,"Don't be fooled by how detailed and clear the first weeks videos are. The second thru the final weeks are lacking details and explanations and found myself lost during most of the videos. There were even a few typos and errors. Be ready to do a lot independent research and learning from other sources in order to complete the weekly quiz. I was unable to complete the final project of this course due to the lack of knowledge provided by the lecture videos and some of own research. I was hoping to complete the specialization for this, but it doesn't seem like this course provided me with enough to proceed.** The use of excel on the weekly basis was poorly integrated with the flow of the course.",1
14806,"This course was a loss of time and money. Except from week 3 material, the rest can be found on the internet and should be required by everyone who wants to take that specialization.

104330,This course needs too much C/C++ knowledge and the test are far too code oriented. You have to give textual answers without having enough help for memory calculation.,1
93767,"Very poorly constructed. There are major jumps in the difficulty of material that are completely unnecessary. The material could very easily be broken down into more manageable and comprehensible chunks. There is no repetition of any exercise or function to engrain any of the material. This course suffers grossly from the ""curse of knowledge"". If it were structured in a way where (a) material was broken down into smaller bits, ideally as beta tested by true rank novices and (b) all materials or specific functions were presented with repetition, similar to how khan academy structures its math section, then this course would be much better. I would also assume, given a and b, that there would be higher retention and comprehension. The expected time requirements are also wildly amiss. Try beta testing this on TRUE rank novices. The program suggests that this is for ""beginners"". I find it doubtful that a true beginner would fare well in this course.",1
32144,"I do not like this course. There are far too many prejudicial ideas - even in the first unit. A language does not have to be used by a single / unified group to define it as a language. Esperanto is a perfectly valid language, fully capable of expression, and does not belong to a single / unified group. There are no native speakers, either - which does not rob it of the fact that there are winners of the Nobel Prize for literature who write in it. The things you are saying about language are not merely willfully ignorant, they are highly offensive & prejudicial. I cannot conscience supporting a course like this.",1
11665,"Instructor speaks too slow and sometimes hardly audible with my earphones plugged in with 100% sound. Incredibly slow paced. Coffee must!!! Too much of story and history and introduction. Much less material presented for concepts shown. Much of the lecture time is wasted on things which does not matter, for example Djikstra shortest path... I would be more interested to know about the algorithm than a huge lecture on who is Djikstra, and also would like to have some exercise to implement the same and realise. Very unsatisfied with the course. But there is no other courses offered for C++ programming language in English Language. Not worth the time.",1
63997,"This course was ultimately frustrating to take. There is a gap in the material presented and the skill set needed to complete the assignments. Using optional methods to complete this course, such as to use the textbook and forums, is too time consuming (deciphering a text book) or insulting (forum mentor responses).To to solve the assignments, it usually involved trying to 1. refreshing yourself in math concepts not used by a beginner or non-mathematician, 2. deciphering what exactly the poorly written questions were asking, 3. scouring the textbook or internet for functions or strategies never covered in the lecture, 4. having snarky and unhelpful remarks by mentors.The unprofessional behavior of the mentors was especially hard to handle. Even from the early week's lectures we learned about semantics, and how simple mistyping could lead to programming errors, so I wrongly assumed the mentors would understand that some of us would probably make simple errors. For example, in the final homework I had a simple mistake, but since we cannot show code, it led to more frustration and a mentor basically just saying ""we covered this already."" I'm well aware of what we covered, but if someone is stuck on a problem, there needs to be a much better way of helping that person. I did not want to write in the forums after my initial foray in the forum led one mentor to just tell me ""your logic is wrong"", and the spout the same simple strategies of the lecture that could not help on the complex assignment.There probably will not be anything fixed with this course since it seems like it has been the same for years now. Please fix the questions, stop using Project Euler, and let people directly message code to mentors. Will probably save time rather than try to blindly (and frustratingly) explain code over and over again. Ultimately, I felt that unless someone either has previous experience in coding, or has no work to do other than to do this course, it still is not worth it to just obtain a certificate.",1

That's clearly not enough for a course. Students can google for tutorials by themselves.Project: The projects mentions classes, which are not covered in the course. It was then also my impression from the peer reviews, that some students without prior knowledge were just lost.There are many great tutorials on the web which offer more insights and give students a much more fundamental knowledge than this course.",1

There is value in asking students to learn on their own, but this course goes much too far with that, giving problem sets that are virtually unsolvable without prior experience in data wrangling in R or some other data language. This leaves serious, hardworking students with little choice but to troll the forums for solutions. Hardly the best way to learn the intricacies of this subject.",1

Some assignment files are not Mac friendly or is just not viewable by all students (I can't tell). Materials are quite good but grading is subject to broad interpretations and there is no human to provide guidance on what are the best practices. To think that I paid for the specialisation in order to take the graded assignment AND I have to do the grading BUT I do not receive support? This is ridiculous.

The teacher asked us to do tons of things without explaining how and used tons of complicated math formulas without explaining what they were, what they did, or when and how to use them. There were also actual incorrect answers in the videos on occasion, so that even if you did do things correctly, you would think you were wrong and be confused, and there were a lot of inconsistencies between the spreadsheets used in the videos and the methods used to solve things compared to the actual spreadsheets given to us, which makes things pretty impossible to learn. If you're more advanced, it may be easier to find and understand the differences between the video and the spreadsheets, but the whole point of this class is that it is for beginners.",1

I would like to think that the course designers would take some sort of appropriate action to remedy this.How exactly this would be done is up to the course designers but I would suggest that another downloadable PDF document showing all the questions would be extremely useful and necessary.I look forward to a response.Regards, Trevor Farley",1

31782,"This course has great videos. I give it such a low rating to get your attention and point out some serious problems. This is a certification course in how to teach English as a second language. What was not apparent to me though is that you have to take 2 parts of the specialization before getting certified and it will take over a year! Also, there is close to no teacher participation in the module I took and there are no mentors or student teachers (that might change in future classes I would hope, but no guarantees) and there was close to zero feedback of my work or even in the discussion area and no authoritative feedback. Even the peer reviews require your classmates ONLY to judge you based on whether you actually tried to answer the question, if it was between one and three paragraphs and one other silly thing that I can't even remember now. No one is required to give actual feedback and a lot of the assignments were written by students in horrendous English, but that is not to be considered. With so many people taking this course for whom English is not a first language, even these very simple instructions were often misunderstood and people had problems with getting credit for their assignments. Also, even though the videos are really well-done, they are short and contain little information for the price. I figured that I was paying about $50 an hour for the lectures at regular speed. There are also little to no resource links etc. for further study so the lectures are pretty much the only thing you get. If you are a native English speaker who doesn't mind spending an entire year and the cost for well-done videos on the subject is not important, then this course if for you. If however you think this is going to cost only $200 and you would have interaction with teachers and you would get a certification in about half a year... I want to make sure you realize, that is NOT what this specialization is! If you are NOT a native English speaker, this course is designed well I think for people who do not speak English as a native language, who might even have a low level of English, yet who are teaching English already in foreign countries and would have difficulty acquiring certification any other way and therefore don't mind taking a full year to complete the course or the price and for whom not having someone give them feedback would be considered an asset. I have recommended it to friends who are not native speakers of English, but as a native speaker I found it slow, expensive and the assignments to be actually annoying. It's perfect though for my foreigner friends... as long as they understand it's real length and cost! THE CERTIFICATION WILL TAKE OVER A YEAR AND COST AROUND $400.",1

First of all, I don't know WHY I'm failing the test cases, I just am. Your program runs through maybe 100 tests to ensure correctness but somehow the instructors decide you should only see the first 3. But then, I try posting on the forums to receive help only to have it removed. Quite frankly, I have spent well over 10 hours at this point on a single problem and I've created my own tests and I have looked at all the very vague hints given in the forums and I still have no clue what to do. I have school, a job, and yet I'm losing all this productivity because I'm running all these damn tests hoping on the off-chance that I catch whatever weird bug it is that's failing my code.

103935,"Very knowledgeable educators.Course is given in a q&a style which is very very good for a web based course since the questions often are exactly what i want to ask.However, think the course can still be improved, especially in the following aspects.(1) examples in the course are not thought through ahead. Instead, educators came up with them on the spot. that way it may not be the best example to convey the message, plus the videos are made unnecessarily long in this way. Think it's good that for a programming course to show real time programming sometimes. But to do this all the time is a bit too much and therefore inefficient. Comparing to some other courses, think this one could really benefit if the educators could give some thought on how to teach, especially to think from a student perspective.For example: about the capability of overwriting and defining new operators, the example given was to define a knife operator and to overload plus operator to stew vegetables. Both examples do not make much sense to me. Although i did understand that it's nice that one can define his/her own operation/operator, when the examples came I actually got confused -- how do i stew vegetables with code??(2) Some of the quiz questions I don't find useful. For this course I need lots of time to complete the quiz in contrast to other coursera courses I did. This is because i need to actually read the documentation in order to answer the quiz questions since they are really in depth. In this way, to do the quiz is actually the way to learn. But some questions are quite artificial, for example, there's a multi-choice question about ""what are the different ways one can find help...""(3) Finally, I find the video and the quiz very abstract. that it's very difficult to follow without making a line of code myself... Also it is not clear what the educators expect as a pre-requisite for taking this course. Sometimes things are explained as if the listeners have no programming background at all. some other time, a concept is explained so fast I wonder whether i should have known objective-C in order to follow this course...",1

5479,"About two years ago I completed Dr. Mine's course ""Data Analysis and Statistical Inference"" and was quite impressed by it. I always hoped that there'd be a follow up on bayesian statistics, so I was really excited when I heard that a course on this topic had finally been created. However while attending the course I became more and more disappointed. Dr. Mine does a nice job explaining things, other teachers in this course aren't as talented. Most slides / videos are quite useless for teaching because they skip over important steps without giving appropriate explanations. Also I was quite disappointed that this course pretty much only focuses on conjugate priors. MCMC is only skimmed over and the introduction to MCMC is more than questionable - instead of showing a simple example, MCMC is squeezed into the topic of bayesian model selection. Another point is R - this course doesn't really teach bayesian stats with R. It teaches how to call one-liners like bayes_inference (from package statsr) or bas.lm (from package BAS) instead of lm. This is totally disappointing. I wish this course would skim over conjugate prior methods and then focus on MCMC sampling methods by teaching how to build interesting and practically useful models using JAGS/STAN/PyMC/whatever. For anyone interested in bayesian stats I'd recommend reading ""Doing Bayesian Data Analysis - Using R, JAGS, and STAN"" and ""Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers"".

Instead only a very detailed and specialized answer is accepted.

90183,"The course is very bad and feels thrown together at the last minute. Learning A* and Dijkstra's algorithm is great however the assignments require you to learn not just the little details but to ""discovery"" techniques not even mentioned in the course material. In addition, you must have strong matlab programming skills and be familiar with much matlab functionality in order to debug some of the assignments. You must have more knowledge concerning matlab than any of the course material or pointers provides. Meaning that beginners will NOT pass this course. The automatic grader provides no feedback at all except pass or fail. This is unfortunate as it can look like your code is working correctly but, the grader is using some edge cases to grade the code but will not include any information indicating what to look for. This is really atrocious. Although the TA's do occasionally provide answers to questions. The total amount of time TA's spend answering questions is just really poor. Don't expect even well asked questions to be answered at all. In addition, the coded template quality upon which your own code depends is horrible and thrown together. You will spend way too much time analyzing it for clues as to what went wrong. Sadly, enough all of these issues have caught up with me and I was unable to pass assignment 2 part 2. Even, though everything looks like it works and achieves the desired goal and even works with all of my own test cases. The grader is merciless. Perhaps, in the feature more time can be devoted to make this course better and I can spend more time learning how the algorithms and maths work rather than matlab and the automatic grader. At this time I don't feel like my money was well spent on these courses. I don't think I would like to risk another 50 dollars learning matlab and debugging the automatic grader on any of the other courses in this specialization.

How do i interpret the results of the regression for making informed business decisions? How do I predict an outcome with a Tree or Neural Network?

The presentations are filled with strange icons and drawings appearing every here and there, making not much of a professional impression.After watching videos, in just about 5 minutes after the lecture is over, the retained information was always going to zero. Sometimes I had to rewind the video to retrieve the points they were trying to make. Or maybe I just didn't want to listen to them. But it seems impossible due to the fact I am interested, and I do finish every course on Business writing I run into. Always with 100% final grade.The overall demeanor is not as professional as it has to be.

The instructor's videos have shown me very little of what I need to understand the concepts.

It's entirely possible that you could be stranded with no one to grade your work - Coursera's suggestion if this should occur is that you should beg on the forums - or transfer your work to a later session of the same course.

90261,"The course contents are unfortunately very poorly designed, and this has been an ongoing trend in this overall specialization.The weekly lecture videos are at times quite unclear and leave more questions unanswered than they answer. I (and other learners) have found glaring gaps in the course content again and again. The examples that the lecture videos use do not nearly cover the variety of datasets being used by the learners in the course; and the least that could have been done is to at least inform learners of what to expect if they were dealing with a different research question and using an alternate dataset.I know the defense may be that the videos are meant to be introductory / gateway to a deeper understanding of that particular topic. The course moderators / instructors did a terrible job in keeping up with answering key questions that were posted in the discussion board. Yet most of the times when I was still searching for answers, looking up similar introductory videos in Youtube were far more helpful (and I didn't have to pay to watch them).The assignments are poorly worded because the instructions are not always very clear, which in my opinion set up a lot of learners including myself for failure. The lectures are often broader than what should be considered when finishing the weekly assignment. It wasn't even clear at times of what was exactly being expected in the assignment. The rubric that I had to use to mark my peers' work meant their analysis had gaps because the criteria for assessment is not transparent AT ALL during the submission of an assignment (they are starkly different in terms of details).All to say that I have been quite frustrated despite my best efforts to learn from these materials and much MUCH more can be done to improve the actual content of the lectures.Please consider adding alternate resources AS WELL where learners can go seek the right answers if the answer is not provided by the lecture materials. This can help to cut back on countless precious hours for those who are juggling a full-time job and retraining / career change like I am, not to mention the countless other scenarios of other learners out there.I am neither inattentive nor lazy, and learning this content is very important to me, if it wasn't clear through my comments here already.One last comment, for those of you who are all very sceptical let me tell you that I know that I don't have to be a statistician to grade the course contents, and I really hope the intructors are paying attention to these and similar comments from those enrolled in this specialization and the others who have completed the course.",1

38641,"As other reviewers have noted, this course is NOT for beginning programmers! (Unless maybe you are a mathematical genius with total recall.)I have a little background in programming, HTML and CSS, but I found this course to be an absolute nightmare. It would be interesting to find out if any of the rave reviews came from real beginners.Most of the problems have already been noted by other reviews, so I will only mention a few that I did not see mentioned.The course requirements should include hardware and software essentials. In particular, the student has no choice but to use Android Studio. If their system is not running a 64bit OS at 2.4 GHz with at least 8 GB of RAM, it can literally take DAYS for Studio to complete the build so that the student can do anything with assignment code.There is a desperate need for a glossary. The course dives in with more acronyms than the military, and assumes the attmpting learner already has a handle on APIs, SDKs, etc., not to mention many other technical terms (interfaces, ...). If I asked the average programmer to evaluate the MT based on comparisons with the Complutensian Polyglot and Codex Alexandricus, the effect would probably be about the same.Another glaring omission for beginners is a battery of exercises for each concept/skill.As for ""We've organized all these topics into units that represent roughly 4-6 hours of work each,"" that is absurd! If you multiplied that by 10, it would still be a stretch.I have no doubt about the programming and technical competence of the instructors (though there are some errors in a number of the instructions). And I'm sure they are very nice people who really want others to learn. The root problem seems to be what professional communicators call ""The Curse of Knowledge"" -- a syndrome in which a person is so familiar with their subject that they cannot begin to imagine what it is like for someone who is not.My recommendation to a beginner is to look somewhere else. Take a good introductory course in Java before diving into the vastly more complex world of the Android environment. I am not qualified to evaluate the course from the perspective of an experienced programmer, but I have noted that they are frustrated by clutter caused by token attempts to make this a beginner course.My recommendation to the faculty is to completely re-engineer this whole specialization. They should have a separate set of courses truly designed for beginners, and they should get help from qualified instructional designers who specialize in online adult education. (Might not be a bad idea to get the VU English department to review the lecture text as well.)My recommendation to anyone is to never believe anything Coursera tells you about a course. Audit the course BEFORE you pay any money! This is especially important if the course has not actually started. This course started two months late, and I could not get a refund before the course even got under way!After taking nearly 6 months to wade through a little over half the course requirements, I decided to look at the rest of the assignments and project. This removed all doubt that to continue was a hopeless waste of time. So, I decided to end the nightmare, and I'm glad it's over!",1

Instead, why don't you compress some valuable learning nuggets into half the course time, instead of hearing you ready through your ocean of bullet points, and needlessly underline (in red) the current bullet point your reading. Seriously, this is one the poorest quality lectures I've ever done!The quality of peer assignments to grade are a joke. Classmates are simply copying bits and pieces of the lecture material to make up the 'market sizing memo'.I seriously doubt the learning value in this class, and the quality of instruction.",1

Looked at the ceiling Buddha 97% of his screen time.The reading was too disjointed and the book on Mindfulness is really more commercial and repetitious that one would expect of a course in Coursera. Professor Wright is too laconic, phlegmatic and unengaging.

If you can download a file and take a screenshot then you've got what it takes to pass this class.The optional assignments are far too focused around a new piece of video sharing technology that the instructor and associates have developed. Unfortunately, the technology adds almost nothing beneficial to the class and is probably to blame for the sheer lack of quality in the rest of the class.In fact, the entire Capstone feels like it was so haphazardly put together that it can only be described as the most contrived beta-test I've ever been a part of.

But I've also seen really well-written code in all the languages *but* R, I have yet to see any code in R that is flexible, maintainable, and clear. Which leads me to think that no such code exists, or it's so rare that it doesn't matter.

The entire course could be condensed down into a ""list of questions to think about while designing your game world"" - it really doesn't contain anything more than that.Sometimes entire segments are dedicated to trivial things (such as ""your game could have invisible walls!""), whereas in other segments he works through a hundred different questions without going in-depth to any of them.Speaker is hard to understand due to his lack of proficiency with the English language and the subtitles are often incorrect.On the plus side, you will learn what a ""ha-ha"" is.",1

Secondly, there was no interaction between the students and the doctor supervising the course in the discussion blogs. Thirdly, I believe that the assessment was too easy. I suggest a 60% passing grade with a more challenging assessment. Finally, this is my personal opinion. I enjoyed the course and I would like to see more improvement in the future.",1

His hand writing is poor, and he does a lackluster job of explaining what exactly he's doing.Finally, pure lecture with no notes is almost impossible to learn, as there's nothing to read and study.I'd rate this course a 1/10, take the course on iTunes from Caltech instead.",1

There, now you have been warned.This part of the specialization has been put together in a haste, without effort and absolutely without any care of teaching. I'm completely shocked and disappointed.In other words:It is a complete joke and a sad excuse for a MOOC. Shame on you University of Toronto!Yes, harsh words, and here's why:The course description does not reflect the contents nor the final assignment. Face tracking? That's pretty far from what I expected from this when I paid $284 for the specialization.In total, there is only 25minutes of video lectures. Really? That's it? It's way too little for a capstone project course.Staff does not care about learners's concerns. Zero effort to respond in the discussion forums. It takes days before there is any response at all.The assignment descriptions and requirements are sparse and vague.

The slides are mostly just a list of bullet points, with very few intuitive figures or charts (normally figures/charts are easier to understand and remember, even the simple ones).

But in the end, you are suddenly required to do some practical C programming in Contiki (an embedded OS), which you need to spend some time to figure out quite a number of practical issues just for a successful run.",1

Nothing inherently wrong with that but when your course title has the word 'EXCEL' in it one would reasonably expect the instructor to actually demonstrate using excel. Nope, not here.If you've never heard of linear regression or Bayes Theorem don't bother with this course. Honestly. While those things may be easy to explain without the math they are very difficult concepts to implement and a simple 10 minute video won't clear the fog.You absolutely will not 'master' data analysis with this course. I've used Excel for over 15 years, daily, and to have the gall to say your course will 'master' something with a few videos is misleading and deceptive.If it wasn't for the TA/Mentors who do the lions share of work in the forums answering questions and deciphering the questions so students can understand them this course would be an abysmal failure.If you're wanting to jump on the data analysis/ scientist bandwagon look elsewhere. i.e. EdX has a great course on a true introduction to data analysis that is more in line with people's impression of actually using excel in that context.Now, having bashed the course I do believe the instructor to be a very competent and knowledgeable individual, but I feel he's been in academia too long and has grown accustomed to teaching those who've been in school continuously and still have algebra/ stats fresh in their minds vs. those who need to brush away the cobwebs.

After reviewing all videos of week 4 twice, I quit.- Lectures often lack a continuous thread to follow. Back and forward jumps in time are common. Timelines at the end sometimes help, but are shown too late.- The forum is abandoned! To the point of time there are three (!) posts in the forum and none of the forum operators.

The video lectures are poorly done, including errors and misstatements that could have been edited out, but it appears that no one bothered to edit the raw footage before uploading it.There is not so much instruction as an overview.

The course is pretty light on technical details and there could [and perhaps should] have been much more beyond-the-scenes content, as well as references to specific documents and events in order to justify this course's existence.In other words, if you are a techie and are indeed interested in this topic, chances are that you already know most of the material taught.",1

Physical concepts like 'resultant moment', 'inertial and body-fixed frame' and 'torque' are used without definition. Mechanics is not listed as a prerequisite but it should be.(ii) Lectures are very mathematical but proofs, intuition and good problem sets are all missing. Listening to a math lecture without doing challenging problems or deriving mathematical results to build intuition can be a waste of time. Check out John Cochrane's Asset Pricing 1 and 2 or Tim Roughgarden's Algo 1 and 2 for great examples of thoughtful problem sets and intuitive derivations.(iii) Way too much powerpoint! Speed reading a static powerpoint slide overloaded with dense mathematical formulas without using pointers or animations to focus the students attention is a recipe for confusion and frustration. I find hand written derivations, even when the handwriting is a little sloppy, much easier to follow than a static page of formulas plus a sound track. Hand written derivations impose a natural pace and focal point to the content. Check out Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra, Sebastian Thrun's Artificial Intelligence for Robotics and Andrew Ng's Machine Learning for examples of good derivations of mathematically sophisticated material.(iv) The programming assignments while fun were somewhat ad hoc and disconnected from the lecture material, specifically, the main task of every single assignment was to hand tune a pd controller.

The professor was not prepare for the lectures and confused/forgot sometime. I was hoping that the Nobel prize winner would teach something that complicated in the simple way. The questions in the exam ask mostly about year, person, numbers which is not the good exam per my perspective. If you want the have the certificate from Yale, you can take this course.

There are many buzzwords but no real explanations. The programming assignments are only doable because most of the work has been done by the people designing the assignments. There is very little left for the students. Furthermore, the procedures, that are already given, are not very well documented. Hence, a lot of guess work is required to figure out how things should work. Furthermore, little effort has been spent to structure the procedures that are already given. Altogether, this makes doing the programming assignments very unsatisfying.Finally, the professor presenting the materials does not take part in the discussion forums. Contrary to other courses that I have attended at Coursera, this time the discussion forum was no help at all.",1

This is a mathematics course and your paying customers are not going to use the knowledge from this course in their jobs. This is not an indictment of the instructor, but of the content itself.

So much time is wasted in the videos with arduous explanations of trivialities, and so little taken up with the imparting of meaningful knowledge, that in the end I abandoned the videos altogether. The quizes were basic (largely based on recall of, rather than application of knowledge), as were the programming assignments (nearly all of which were spoon-fed, with the tasks sometimes being simple as multiplying two matrices together).If you are serious about machine learning and comfortable with mathematics (e.g. elementary linear algebra and probability), do yourself a favour and take Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks course instead, which is far more interesting and doesn't shy away from serious explanations of the mathematics of the underlying models.",1

102649,"Very very introductory. This course explores the Buddhist theory of suffering and liberation by comparing it to evolutionary psychological theories.It is not a deep course on Buddhism - it lacks any substantive discussion of differences between Buddhist schools, of the difficulty of reconstructing the ""historical"" Buddha (a problem as difficult as reconstructing the ""historical Christ""), of the fact that Buddhism as popularized in the West is actually quite different from any of the Asian forms of Buddhism, etc.Also, evolutionary psychology is controversial in its own right - one criticism of it is that it creates ""just-so"" stories about the origins of mental processes that are impossible to verify (or falsify). These objections are well known, but are not confronted in the course.A scholarly much sounder and deeper course is the one on Tibetan Buddhism from University of Virginia. It suffers from truly appalling presentation (the video lectures are some of the most boring I have ever watched), but the diversity of angles from which Buddhism is examined, and the depth of content are really outstanding.",1
85609,"Unfortunately, this is a poorly designed course. It seems like it is strictly scripted, the instructor looks like she's reading the material. It's very boring to watch.

She keeps hinting on discussing the topics further in different section (Which didn't happen) this leaves me confused on why not discussing its details now?! Discussing SWOT analysis is a strategic concern, and as a PR related course we should see more related to marketing and communication techniques as a result of the search. But guess what? its not there... This course Is not worth the money.",1

25598,"Not very informative content, some parts are interesting but not worth the money.The worst thing is, all assignments are writting work that are evaluated by colleagues, meaning, it is purely objective, to the extent that one question asks if my uploaded file is in a readable format, example pdf, txt...etc and two out of three marking my pdf file as not!!! and not even leaving a comment why they are giving that bad score on obvious things!",1

All you get is a basic knowledge about All Things Cyber™.The recommended readings are all over the place, the video captions look like they're just a basic speech recognition and like nobody actually proof read them. They're full of errors. Lecturers say one word, captions show a completely different word. Plus, they're full of spelling errors. (Kadafi regime in Libya!? Really!?)You can get the same amount of knowledge by reading two or three Wikipedia pages. Don't waste your time on this course.",1
99678,"This course needs a total overhaul; in its current state it is a detriment to both Coursera and the Wharton Online brand. First, there was relatively little content; there was less than an hour of lectures each week and no actual programming involved. Second, the material was pitched at a very basic level, but not in a good way. Third, the tests didn't manage to even test the material being covered. For example, when given a mean and stdev, when asked to find a value, often the lecture would use an approximation ( i.e., a 2-tailed 95% distributed = 2.00 std devs. ) This is a class on excel: there is NO excuse for not introducing norm.s.inv and norm.s.dist when asking that question. When the test required the ""approximation"" rather than the exact calculation? Everything about this course was wrong, it needs to be scrapped and thrown away.",1
81286,"If this class is truly designed and welcomes beginners who have no knowledge in SEO as it is described in course introduction, assignment instructions should be provided with sample writings or rubrics. The writing assignment instruction reads,for example, ""Identify headers, alt-text, and etc. and recommend how to improve them for optimization."" Where does it say provide alt-text images for recommendation, make a tie to the recommendation, and list references for the images recommend, if not 3 points off? The lectures are short, doesn't show much details of what is expected for audit writing or analysis writing, but my 2 page analysis or audit is not enough because a thorough rubric expects to see this and that that is not even mentioned in instruction? It is a common sense that a writer has to be detail-oriented with recommendations? Then the course SHOULD not encourage SEO beginners who has never seen SEO audits or analysis paper. If not, assignment instruction should be listed thoroughly as rubric, so that a beginner SEO student can pass the writing and take it as a learning experiences. Endless flunking mal-grading system, is this Coursera's education method?",1

95469,"This is in fact the worst course so far. Mainly because of auto grader. Here are my reasons.Actually I did not complete the course at all. But I suddenly got a message saying that I have completed the course. I was working on the first problem of the 4th assignment. I did a provisional submission to see if my answer was right. Auto grader reported the grade for the 3rd assignment and said that I have passed the course. Any submission I did after that was not graded at all.The assignments are not very clear. Looks like I had a older version of the questions while others had a different version. I was stuck in a particular problem because auto grader did not give me a clear feedback as to why I was incorrect. I wasted too much time on this already.The assignments require too much research outside what is covered in the videos. I don't feel that is right. The assignment requires that we research on Stack Overflow and Pandas documentation. I strongly feel that such activities should be performed only outside the course work when we try to solve real world problems. Course assignments should be reasonably given based only the materials covered in video. This was taking too much time.TThe discussion forums are not giving clear hints. When we are stuck in a problem, we are not able to proceed further. I still son't know the answers for certain problems because the coordinators do not explain the answers well. When we complete assignments we don't get to see the instructor's solution.The video instructions were too fast paced. The instructors do not pause and explain critical aspects of the code.Overall I am very disappointed with this course. There are much better videos on Youtube and Lynda than this . I am sorry. I never thought it would be this bad. The first course on Python from University of Michigan was really very good.",1

Other schools like Gnomon WorkShop and DVDs like ""Eat3D"" and many others out there, which gives e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here!

They didn't explain the difference between wordpress.com and wordpress.org even though they mentioned them both. They talked about hosting but didn't explain how to do it. They mentioned hosting on bluehost but didn't give any instructions. The few tidbits of information that they did give about using wordpress were so brief with no examples. They mentioned Jetpack but didn't say what it was. They didn't explain what benefit adding the social media icons would have or how to link them.

There was NO communication from Coursera whatsoever regarding this--no email, nothing to me or the class as a whole. So, we just had to keep checking and submitting ratings to see if it would finally be accepted. I find this bizarre, to say the least. Now, I am in the third course and the SAME thing is happening! I work full time, have a second job, go to school, raise two boys as a single parent and time is of the essence for me! I do not have time to waste! I keep wasting my time with tech issues.

There is a lot of variability in OSs. Many errors are often encountered. There is no help.Among the things the course requires are two (three?) IDEs for Scala (I note the video tutorials says you just need some sort of IDE... but you need IntelliJ, and Eclipse to submit...). The guides show how to get started on a Mac.

95053,"The course is a great course in terms of the knowledge and experience of the instructor and the helpfulness of the staff. I gave it 2 stars for two reasons.1) The videos are deceptively short. In MOOC instructional design, you normally design short videos because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an in-person university student. However, in this course, even though the video is short, it is really 5-10 times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and replay and rewind and replay several times while trying it yourself. So the timings are not truly accurate. If you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly. In this case, I wish they were more honest with the times by actually typing the code in real time while teaching. I would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestible.2) The hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science (decomposition, algorithmic thinking, etc.), I was really just searching on stack overflow for how to put it into python. It's poor instructional design to only teach somethings and expect students to complete assignments without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment. It would be ok if it were an accidental mistake, but this seems to be purposeful. This happened not just in course assignments but sometimes even in mid-roll video-overlaid quizzes where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown. This was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying mid-lecture problems to no avail. It cause all the timings of the course to be off (#1 caused the video timings to be severely off and #2 meant that the course assignment estimates were HUGELY miscalculated). Good instructional design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment. For some reason that was avoided again and again in this course.Great material though. I loved learning.

93428,"If you are planning to learn R, then go and buy a book. This course is a complete scam. At least don't pay any money. The reasons;1.) They advertise that you need couple of hours of study per week. That's a lie, you have to study much more than that unless if you know a little R programming.2.) The quiz questions are totally unrelated from the lessons. They teach you the basic stuff but they expect you to accomplish intermediate quizzes.3.) The instructor has no idea how to teach. May be he is trying to prove something. I couldn't really understand his motives. If you really want to teach that's simple. You do couple of extra videos and teach whatever you are asking in quizzes, or tell us to read a certain material. He didn't do any of them which means he either doesn't know how to teach or this specialization is a complete scam.4.) And I don't really understand what coursera is doing by the way? What kind of a business model is this. I was planning to enroll many specializations but now I am not going to do it. So think about how much they are loosing. Where is the quality assurance. Just because one guy comes up to you and say that he teaches this and that do you believe them?MY ADVICE TO YOU: DON'T PAY ANYTHING FOR THIS SPECIALIZATION.

101103,The whole course is nice and there were lot of new things to learn. I am not from an IT background but still found it very useful. However the capstone was a bit of disappointment. I believe they should have included some teaching authority to check the Capstone projects for my better understanding. The whole capstone is reviewed by peers which is great but as per certification I believe there should be some professional help too. I even tried to speak to someone over the phone but there was no number available. I ended up with chatting with some one on the help center but that was not very helpful either.

Speaker glosses over them without giving concrete examples2) The structure of the course is poorly configured. On several occasions, inline quizzes test you on concepts that haven't been introduced until later in the video, forcing you to guess at answers. Also, the assignment portion of the course asks you to submit a word or pdf with images, but it wasn't configured to allow uploads. You could only submit text in a text box. I realized I wasn't the only person with the issue when I graded assignments from others who had trouble submitting their assignment. In some cases, I believe students failed that portion of the course because they could not figure out how to submit. I have some IT background and was able to share my homework through my shared drive fortunately.3) The speaker should re-record his lecture. It was obvious (or at least seemed as if) he was reading a teleprompter. There were many awkward pauses between sentences that made it hard to listen to. Often times, the audio presentation were inconsistent with the words in the slide, making it confusing because I didn't know which I should be following.",1

And what value is their feedback to me. I signed up to get some experience and to also get feedback from those more experienced than I. I'm less interested in what my peers have to say and more interested in the feedback of the instructor who has years more experience than most of us. To pass assignments off of 4 or 5 peer reviews is worthless. There's no value in that. What does the instructor think??? Would HE pass us? He occasionally drops a line in the discussion forum, but no direct feedback to the students.I think this class should have a cap on enrollment so that the instructor can actually review and provide feedback to the students.

Thus the least interesting and also the longest - makes little sense!As I said, I'm sorry to give this rating, but it needs to be said. The teacher seems like a great guy. And I'm sure he's killing it teaching statistics and R Studio at Uni, but using R studio to such a standard just doesn't seem like the everyday work an HCI designer would do.

There were many errata that really should have been fixed in the beta iterations of this course.Thirdly, I really would like to see more application and less discussion of implementing algorithms.Fourthly, the ""scaling"" section was also a major disappointment. While it is mildly interesting to learn about stochastic gradient descent, I think it would have been more interesting to have a discussion about how classifiers work in a parallelized computing environment or actually to try one out using Spark.Finally, given that GraphLab/Dato/Turi was just acquired by Apple, I question whether it is worthwhile to take this course as ALL the materials are taught using a library that in all likelihood will cease to exist.",1

However, I have very little good to say about this course offering. I had numerous issues with what was offered:The videos were generally ok, but some had poor audio. There was minimal video (compared to any other course I have done), and more detail and discussion in videos would have been more helpful.Some of the video material is out of date already, as I suspect Bluemix layout has changed - this made navigation a bit confusing.The downloadable Pi image has changed since the course was prepared, and the newer image has different code as standard. I ended up having to muddle-through manually loading packages and dependencies, etc. to get things to work.I lost many hours trying to debug and rework assignment code, just to get it to work for the grader tool. This was further complicated by not having good debug output from the grader to work with. Naturally some of the grader fails were my own fault, but the majority of issues I ran in to could have been avoided by better worded assignments and/or more detail about requirements.Lastly, it was taking sometimes days to get any response to requests for guidance on the forums / discussions. In fact, I think the majority of useful assistance came from other students who had run in to the same issue(s). When you have a course that is such a short time frame, you really need to be providing assistance in a timely manner.I could not, in any good faith, recommend anyone take this course in the future - which is a little saddening.

While the importance of ""Usability"" was rightly emphasized, the representation in terms of examples, case studies, etc. was simplistic. I appreciated having my attention drawn to the pitfalls of HCI design and the consequent failure of the corresponding systems. However, the solutions were presented as if: 1.) there are always ""correct"" interface/usability choices; 2.) the ""correct"" choice is all that's needed for the system to be optimally functional; and 3.) there is never a tension between usability and effective functioning of a system (that can't be resolved with correcting the usability).It is irresponsible to suggest, for example, that a user selected memorable password is generally adequately secure without also covering ways that an interface can guide/nudge the user to create a secure password. Wide recognition of the importance of this may be more recent than the studies covered in the course. There is nothing wrong with studying old, seminal research, even in this age of ""Internet time,"" but I wish I wasn't left wondering what, if any, developments had occurred in the decade or so since that research took place.As for tension between usability and security, it absolutely exists. For instance, PGP encryption is a reliable way to secure information, yet making it usable remains a challenge. This is not even mentioned in the entire course. In fact, this course would leave an otherwise uninformed student believing that there are usability solutions waiting to be applied to every cause of info insecurity if the techies would just look. I wish the course had at least acknowledged that there are cases where a slight compromise on usability might be necessary for the sake of appropriate security.Lastly, for those designing an HCI for security, it is important to understand threat models. This concept is also missing from the course.===I reviewed this course (above) immediately after I finished it. I am now in the 3rd week of Software Security, the 2nd course in the Cybersecurity specialization, and am realizing that 2 stars was a generous assessment. Based on the prerequisites of the Software Security course, the Usable Security course, in its current form, is too elementary to be appropriate for people who have the experience/knowledge required for the rest of the courses in this specialization. As I explained above, the course relies heavily on decade-old research but does not cover any developments since. For instance, the usability issues covered in the studies are for ancient versions of browsers with no discussion of how the browsers and our infosec vulnerabilities have changed since those studies were published. Another example is the instructor's eschewing of password managers while many knowledgeable folks in the infosec community today recommend their use. The usability challenges of password managers and a discussion of how they might be mitigated would have been more appropriate.",1

However, with out an outline, slides, notes, structure... something... anything... this class is just a talking head that is painfully hard to pay attention to. If you're an auditory learner and prefer the old school, pretentious, Ivy League lecture hall format this is the class for you.",1

The videos are too short and the samples demonstrated in the videos aren't thoroughly explained.

In my opinion it cannot be the purpose to make your student google basic things that could easily be integrated into the course.Considering that this is labelled as a beginner course I was expecting much more theoretical input. Other courses offer additional slides and scripts that are aligend with the course videos and allow the students to look things up.",1

10063,"Quizzes kept requiring information that was oddly specific (needing an exact decimal number without multiple choice options), which would have been okay except that it was not covered in the lectures.

(From a beginner programmer's view).",1
12228,"Overly-remedial information, but that is not what earns this course such a poor evaluation from me. The poor evaluation comes from the composition of the review quizzes: The end-of-section quizzes ask questions to which there can be more than one correct answer, yet only a single response will receive credit.Example: ""A recommended solution to a problem is valued by an executive because..."" Followed by four possible answers: One of which is clearly incorrect while one makes an awful assumption. These two choices can be eliminated easily. However, the final two options are BOTH UNARGUABLY CORRECT, but only one was briefly mentioned in the material (reading or video), and thus only that one receives credit.Unfortunately, this demonstrates the course creators' desire to value a student's memorization of the instructor's own unique words over the student's assimilation of the course content and ideas.Course-takers beware, this course seems more tailored to stroking Ms. Bravo's ego than to you actually learning anything of commercial value.",1

12150,"Taking this course in January/ February 2017, I found it to be jumbled, out-dated and frustrating.Materials are presented in a chaotic, roundabout way, which is neither chronological nor thematic, leaving huge lacunae. The initial lecture started with an entirely uncontextualised location-visit to Lewes, and mention of the Battle of Lewes in the Barons' War, with plenty of merry jumping over the *rather more important* Magna Carta. In later lectures, there is similar dancing around the English Civil War, which is shocking, given its constitutional importance... and then lots of vague, hand-wavy references to European law. I understand that these lectures were filmed before last summer's shock result in the EU referendum, but - honestly - would it have killed Professor Gearey to have discussed the context and possible implications of the referendum? By contrast, I'm currently following a Futurelearn course which is a repeat iteration of the original material (that's how online courses are viable - I understand that) BUT which the educator cared about enough to updated with topical material from the very week in which we were following it (Week 1 of President Trump)!It would have been far better to have gone into the Common Law course with clear historical anchors (e.g. Magna Carta, Civil War, Great Reform Act, EU membership), which would have given a proper framework for studying the development of common law, through cases and precedent. Instead, we get Professor Gearey sliiiiiiding into half a dozen subjects per lecture and then ""leaving that question there for a later lecture.""I must mention that other lecturer is much more coherent, and that he talks sensibly through various cases, actually demonstrating how precedent works. However, that's just not enough to make up for Professor Gearey's flibbertigibbet style of exposition, which seems to make up the bulk of the course.On a technical level, the un-corrected transcripts of ""lectures"" were a huge headache, since they didn't make much more sense than the lectures themselves, and at times made even less sense, due to incorrect transcriptions. It was particularly frustrating to have legal references mis-spelled (e.g. ""Blackstone"" as ""Blackspen""), making it difficult to track down better sources to supplement the lectures.I can't actually be bothered to see this course through to the end, and am very glad I didn't purchase it.",1

Then there were games to ""purchase"" online to facilitate teaching my dog cognitive skills. The videos were lacking in creativity. I was really disappointed with this, especially since its a cool topic that could easily be presented in a very exciting way.

The videos themselves were divided into two sections -- first a theoretical or classroom like section and a second a lab/programming section going over some coding in Python. The 'classroom' type lectures were pretty reasonably good. But the lab/programming were pretty terrible.They instructor really break down the syntax of the code and just left the student to figure it out.

In week two, the entire language was dumped on us with no real exercises. Then we were asked to write some programs. The programs didn't build knowledge piece by piece - it was just learn the language, now write these random programs. It was very disappointing. I sign up for courses because I want to learn piece by piece and get to practice each new thing. If someone is going to dump the whole of Ruby on me in 1 week I don't need the class, I can buy a book and get the same experience. There also wasn't a good grader provided. This really took the joy out of programming. I keep thinking I'll come back and finish the class but I haven't so far because I dislike how it's presented so much. A true disappointment.",1

Maturity and duration of the bond comparison with the glass of water is referred to, but was not part of the course. For the money - we are getting some shorter version of a bigger course.

That's a reasonable task to perform once or twice, but it rapidly becomes extremely tedious and detracts from the other materials that are being taught.The final assignment doesn't do a particularly good job evaluating the required test condition.If you do take the course I'd want you to know:You should expect to modify the provided code to fix their bugs.There are no ""gotcha"" quiz questions. If you are confused by getting a question wrong you might want to re-try your answer. There seems to be a bug in the way at least one quiz question is set up.On the final assignment you can modify the simulation step where it makes things run in ""real time"".

I would venture to make some suggestions:a. Restrict each video to a max of 7 minutes. More than that makes one sleepy.b. Reduce the number of videos in each module to a max of say 6.c. Instead of having Chris expound it like an audio reading, please include some slides, pictures,tables so that the matter to be learnt becomes self evident and Chris doesn't have to speak so much. A good example is the Coursera ""The Global Financial Crisis"", which I am also doing currently.d. If you feel all the material in this course has to be studied, then to achieve the objectives in (a) and (b) above, divide this course into two parts, Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space - part I & II.e. The written assignments are very simple and do not require any mental resources other than memory. Can you make the questions more challenging? For example, in Telescopes (Assignment 2), can you not ask a question like ""In addition to Atacama, Chile, using Google earth, which other parts of the globe may be suitable for installation of ground based telescopes?"" or ""To obviate the blurring effect of the atmosphere, discuss the possibility of high altitude balloon based telescopes?"" or ""What do you feel about the fact that since today's mobile phones have high computing ability, their components can be used to make a low-cost space based interferometric telescopes?""Kudos to Chris and his team!

Some of the assignment simulations/animations were not working, but I was able to submit the results and get full credit. I was ready to give 2 or 3 stars in this review.Unfortunately, on the last assignment, the sample code and scripts was buggy (even towards the end of the course after it had been pointed out to the staff), and inconsistently written.The final project submit script would not work and it was a trial and error troubleshooting to understand why. Some on the discussion boards were able to submit, but other couldn't. Although my assignment would run as I understand the project should, I could not even submit it. Judging from the discussion boards, I'm not the only one with this problem.Again, the University of Pennsylvania has missed the mark with this class and the robotics series. It is regretful that I must again leave a one star review.I realize this is the first time this course was offered, so there are some issues that need to be worked out.

Even the basic concepts are explained using advanced terms or examples that contain code far beyond a beginners level.They also do not really spend any time going over the programming basics. They discuss them a bit, but they never really give you a bigger picture or really how all the concepts you've learned fit together. There is no real consistency throughout the course, it just seems like they are throwing random concepts at you and hoping you understand. Then they throw you an assignment that requires you to do rather complicated coding (for a true beginner) without any other form of practice before hand.The assignments are also a bit of a mess. All you are really doing is 'filling in the blank'. They give you all this code that has already been written without actually tell you how do to that yourself or what a vast majority of it does and you have to fill in code in a couple places to make it work. But since everything else is written, you can not run the code as you write it to check your work. It will fail because the code is looking for things you haven't written yet. You must write the entire assignment before you can see if the first line of code you wrote works. I find this to be a very poor teaching method. You should be able to check your work as you go, or experiment with different ways of writing things. Instead you are forced to write exactly what they expect.",1

When I contacted coursera.org they had no clue when it is going to start. I am a working professional and my schedule gets very busy when I am on projects. And ever since then whenever the capstone is available my schedule has been very busy. I have completed 2 Assignments in capstone and 4 to go and the 1 year subscription is over. Coursera.org says I have to pay for it again to continue which I am never willing to. There is no courtesy to a student/customer who has paid for the course.

I hope the other courses are not like this.I rated it one star for a couple of reasons.1- I have been in software for many years and I know about software design. I would NOT have expected to have a weeks long course on software design and usability when my desire is to learn about software security. I understand its importance, but this course should be part of a UI design course, NOT in a technical CyberSecurity specialization IMO.2 - the course is all about theory, not about practical matters. Let's admit it - today's security software is not for the uninformed/experienced. Given this, again, I feel this course would be better served in another specialization about UI Design or for software design best-practices.That is my .02. I am moving onto other courses before finishing the Usability Security..... I am aware that I will have to complete this course to get my certification.

I would strongly recommend finding an alternative course devoted to the subject or maybe seeking out a readable textbook.",1

My frustration is not with professor Wobbrock, who is obviously an expert in his field (though sometimes I felt like he's speaking in ""High Valyrian"" and not English). My disappointment lies with UCSD which included the course of such depth of information and a strong requirement for understanding R, without much thought on whether students will be able to follow. I feel that going through this course was largely pointless, because I'm not going to retain much of the depth of the material in the long run.Based solely on this experience, I'm NOT going to be recommending this specialization to anyone.",1

However I sampled some of the course videos in the different courses making this specialization and decided against it.In the course videos we see no teacher or lecturer just pictures of people and power-point slides with a flat voice in the background reading the slides. In my opinion this does very little in making this topic interesting as it comes out flat and more work should have been put into making of this MOOC considering one has to pay for the specialization. There were also no discussion forums of any kind available. More work should be put into the making of the lecture videos by the school to give it a realistic classroom experience.Unfortunately I dropped out of the MOOC because of the poor quality done by the school despite it being a topic of interest for me.,1
5675,"The entirety of this course is ""watch and listen"". There are no hands-on activities/assignments that get you implementing what you are (supposedly) learning. The assignments that are offered are optional and consist of filling in the blank code without actually providing you a way to see how your code works in the big picture.For example - they go on and on about how intents are complicated and tricky, but they don't actually give you a required assignment. It's optional. Then the actual assignment is ""Do this here, and this here, and then this here"" and only when you have completed every step can you actually run the code. But this doesn't actually show you how to build the intent. All you did was write down what they told you to and where. You never actually build anything yourself. You don't actually get an idea of how these things work or how to implement them yourself from scratch.The quizzes are also pointless. Every quiz is multiple choice, select all that apply. There's no thought required, just regurgitation of info from the lectures.Also, the entire week 1 lectures are HORRIBLE. The lectures on git are sssoooo dull that I could not stay awake no matter how much I wanted to. They are given in a monotone, bored tone that will drive you insane.Overall, this course seems more like it was hastily slapped together, without much thought, and then never looked at again.

They have forced me to leave the current session, still unfinished deadlines, missing a single activity after two months of work, and enroll again in the next session, which still nor has begun, delaying all the planning I had made for the entire course and all terms of the following courses.In short, disastrous system to keep deadlines and complete the courses that make it totally useless any planning you have to do to set the course for the months that suit you, which, in my case at least, may at risk which I can complete the full specialization before the deadline.

For example, it says Part 3 is answering NPV. However, Part 3 includes six calculation questions unrelated to the project to be submitted in Parts 1 and 2.4- The forms of putting an answer are unclear, although it mentions how to put a percentage and two decimal points.5- Peer assessment take ages and is unnecessary.6- Discussion forums are deserted islands where no professional staff interaction is given.I've stopped continuing this specialization and I strongly recommend others not to waste their time on it.",1

104389,"Unnecessary extra videos, that could and should be joined together. In particular, in lessons 2 and 3 all ""topic introductions"" could be joined with the following ""let's discuss this topic inside a DAW"" video.Awful dynamic range. In some videos voice of lector is very quiet (-20 dB or less) and sound played from the DAW is much louder (around -6 dB). In other videos, the opposite: loud lector and quiet DAW. Change of microphone setup between intro video and ""in the DAW"" video is also very noticeable and distracting.Repeats of repeats over repeats. This is not needed at all. I could repeat everything by myself, just pause video and replay interesting fragment. I don't need to be reminded how a single background vocal sounds or that we need to change panning each time we add new track. Yes, It should be done from time to time, but not each time. These repeats make the lessons unnecessary long, it feels I could have been told the same information in half of time or less.This combines with very slow pace of a lector. I listened all lessons on 1.5 or even 2.0 tempo, just to not fall asleep.Quizzes are strange. Stupid quesion appeared in quiz three: which key combinations we use in the videos? But why do you ever ask this, how this relates to the topic? I use another DAW in another OS, I even don't have a ""command"" key, I could have changed my hot keys, so your particular hot key setup is not any significance for me. I was expected to be quizzed for which parameters to tune, how it sounds and alike, not this particular crap. Trust me, anyone could figure which hot keys to use. I am not just a monkey, I have an ability to explore my software by myself, I don't need to be told how to copy and paste, and even if I need this I just go look in the manual.",1

The first two weeks were short, introductory programming lessons. Week 3, ""Advanced Swift,"" consisted of one 12-minute video that barely scratches the surface of three separate topics.Many things that I would consider fundamentals for this type of programming course (classes, for example) were rarely even mentioned, much less taught and demonstrated.If you want to learn Swift, look elsewhere. Don't waste your time and money on this course.",1

Why then Stanford University doesn't just email his students this material and let them work on their own instead of doing lectures?I don't see the added value at all. Apart from being able to discuss the topic in the forum with other online students, what's the advantage in comparison to buying a book and doing the exercises there?This course to me started off with the wrong foot. No info on the starting date of the course until the end of September, when instead the course was supposed to start at the beginning of the month. And now the complete absence of videos. This to me seems more like a fuck up on the side of Coursera, which didn't find an agreement with Stanford University so no material had been produced until now. Then, in order not to completely ruin its reputation, Coursera put a bunch of slides calling it an online course and expecting people to buy this lie.I might be wrong and this could be only my theory and nothing else, however, I won't recommend Coursera to anyone after this.

The assignment itself is just opening and saving file in Tableau.2) in weeks 4 peer graded assignment you just asked to write some vaguely defined 1 page description. It doesn't include any Tableau-related activities.Thirdly, quizzes are ambiguous and very general.Overall, this course is just a waste of time. For comparison, you can easily get more useful information about Tableau from the 4 minute long ""Getting started"" video on the Tableau website than from this course.

The quality of the slides and video and so on was still excellent, but the ""teaching"" was horrible. Vast amounts of totally unexplained jargon and very extensive equations were thrown at the students with the apparent assumption that the course was a review for postdoctoral statistics students. When material is beyond the scope of what perspective students can reasonably be expected to understand, faculty members should be honest enough to just say so rather than pretending to teach the subject matter.I appreciate very much what the Duke faculty achieved in the first three courses, but the treatment of Bayesian statistics that I have just suffered through was shameful.",1

It is just what I experienced from this course that I am saying. However, I don't mean to discourage anyone from attempting this course. This review is just a summary of what I felt about the first two weeks of this course.]I don't think this course is for the beginners at all. The teaching method did not quite please me. It appears that the instructors and TAs are simply reading the transcripts and bombarding equations on the screen. Also, the course hasn't made any reading material available, and they are not even providing the slides for the lectures (as of till DEC 2016).I have enrolled and completed a course on mobile robotics from Georgia Tech on Coursera and they were using slides and at the same time the instructors were scribbling equations on the slides and ensuring that they maintain synchronicity with the learning and showing them how a particular equation emerges. They also had lectures which were designed to help learners attempt the quiz and special section about MATLAB and how to build robots. They also provided slides to revise what was mentioned in the lectures. They were teaching and not reading from teleprompter.This course looked lot of theoretical and I am not sure for whom it is designed for. Also, in the discussion forum, I haven't received answer to the questions that I'm posting(since right now it's holiday season, I can exempt them from not replying).I knew I could carry on with this irritation and still get the course certificate for which I've paid for, but then there is no point in wasting time in which the explanation is not clear. It would take me almost 20 to 30 minutes to make notes over a 5 minute long video. I would rather read a book on this subject.I would have appreciated if they followed certain steps:1) Make some course material which will help students read and revise information.2) Suggest some reading/reference material to understand the concepts which are not otherwise covered in this course.3) Use pointers(touch screen devices) to show and point out which equations are being referred to and maintain synchronicity between the information given in the slides and the one said by the instructor.4) Supplementary lectures are extremely fast paced and please don't take derivation of an equation for granted and please do explain.So, if you are looking forward to do this course, I suggest you go forward if you have an in-depth knowledge about vectors, matrices and calculus.",1

I strongly believe that if a person can understand those videos, I'm pretty sure that he knows that 5-years-old-extremly-basic-stuff).As much I like this concept of coursera, ""speak english professionally"" or even ""speak english"" is really a big statement for that course.

Several hours of extensive research yields no usable data which could provide a logical direction to the project. Reading material provided explains mainly the company profile, a few links are blocked due to geographical restrictions, reports that are available are to be purchased etc. While the money invested is not refundable now, however coursera with university team needs to seriously resolve this point.

The instructions were all over the place, and explanations were inadequate. After drumming how important to actually ""code"", he proceeded to present the whole lecture showing small pieces of codes.... on slides. After touting how cool and useful Sublime is as a developer tool, he didn't even use it. After telling everyone how useful regular expression is but not part of this course (so he won't explain), he went on to use regular expressions for all the sample codes for the rest of the lecture. As mentioned, there was no structure as to how he present Ruby/Rails as a programming platform. It was bits of code here, bits of code there. Beside getting a feel of what Ruby syntax is like, there was no learning. I am aware there are suggested readings, but then why doing this MOOC at all.As I check out other courses from the same Ruby specialization, the student numbers are getting smaller. Hardly everyone post on the forums, I also check the Classmates map. I suspect many simply gave up since the Intro classes were so bad.

There needs to be some warning on how to interpret and manage the files so that you get the same numbers being asked for in the test. Again this too me about 10 hours to resolve.

But eventually I fell completely behind and by the time I was performing the exercise 2 submission I was in deep water. There are a lot of mathematical theory and programming theory references along the way as well which I did not like.As a real world programmer I have never really felt compelled to know peano number theory.

The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data. There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone. I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help. I'm sure there is room for improvement on this course and I hope the instructor does work to improve with the course, but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience.",1
21202,NEEEEEED TO EDIT MY PEER REVIEW FROM OTHERS,1
24497,very boring lectures. expected a lot more from something like PWC. Doesn't worth it at all. Didn't learn anything new.,1

11627,"Good material, fair presentation, too many peer evaluations.",1
90054,"I thought this was poor. It was basically a re-hash of the previous module with slightly different tasks. Given that I had to wait three months for the capstone to be ready, I found it a bit rich that my deadline to finish it was a couple of weeks! Don't waste your money/time on this particular module.",1
25191,Course is very high level and teacher inspiring. As I highlighted already it took me 8 hours with a professional to install Pentaho... for what? to explain pivot tables totals. that is very unecessary. Also from Europe virtual machine use is just killing my computer and I end up spending more time crashing and restarting my pc than working on the course. (and I am surrounded by IT professionals in my company for reference). This is sadly a big let down for an excellent course theory wise.,1
19616,Not very well put together. It marked some answers as wrong that were actually correct.,1
28469,This course is based on personal anecdotes and not facts. Many of the examples provided have been proven to be farces and/or practical jokes.,1
5566,"Boring, didn't have strength to finish",1
3694,All this peer grading nonsense is garbage. If we are gonna pay 63$ a month of something we can at least get the proper grading system included.,1

104511,well taught but not what I thought it would be.,1
4463,"Unfortunately, the material and lectures of this course fell short of my expectations. Lectures don't follow a logical path and are all over the place, and some concepts are not expanded as required. Overall, I believe they need to improve how the content is presented, and how it's applied in a real world context.",1
13526,Tree exercise had absolutely no relevant video material. Videos give zero context for why data structures are important or when they are used....Should take a lesson from the Stanford course.,1

93010,"I had really high hopes for this course. I am not a programmer, though in college I learned C, C++, and used MATLAB a fair amount. I wanted to learn R because it is a free software versus paying a licencing fee to use SPSS which I have done in the past. I had already completed the first week of the course and the first week in this course. I went through the slides and I didn't really feel like I learned any actual programming so then to expect to answer questions where you had to program seemed a bit out of left field. As a comparison it felt like they had an hour worth of slides talking about different trees and how to differentiate them then asked you to drive a tank.I then took the time go through two swirl assignments which I hoped was going to fill in the many gaps left by the slides. They were definitely more helpful than the slide show, but I still felt like they would teach you how to add then ask you to multiply.So in general my recommendation would be not to take the course unless you have a fairly solid understand of programming, otherwise you will do what I did and just wasted $50.",1

From my perspective, with his knowledge in this field as being described on his personal web site, he should be able to talk comfortably by looking at the topic on the slide then discuss about it in detail. I would suggest to change the environment to be at the wide open space, like coffee shop, to make this course more attractive. I'm sorry, it is not what I expected.",1

The instructor is not showing us the way we should think about developing programs in NodeJS, but he insists on using PowerPoint slides to show us how to code! It's 2016, and there are way better mediums for communicating with your students. Simply copying and pasting code and explaining what every line does is not the right way of teaching any concept, especially when you are dealing with a new technology. For the start, the instructor can actually type the code and explain what goes through his mind during each step. That way anyone can follow his problem solving methods and benefit from the course.I had to take other online courses on Code School and Pluralsight just to understand what's going on, and later come back to finish the homework.",1

Seriously, so boring!2) There is a high degree of subjectivity in grading essays (peer reviews)This course can benefit from:1) Clearer introduction of concepts using pictures and animations, as well as cutting out the repetitiveness (and the assault of the jargonaut)2) A better approach to grading that places importance on concepts instead of key words (jargon)",1

Instead of auto-grading using well known testing frameworks (like other Coursera courses), the entire grading policy is based on reviews from fellow students which makes your grade subjective, secondly, since the number of mandatory required reviews for each student is fixed at 5 (and is not adjusted with the number of students), it is highly unlikely that all submissions will be reviewed or graded.",1

My impression is that this guy didn't spend any time to prepare this course and just used the material/homework from a more advanced class that he did previously.

187,"First of all, I really enjoyed Professor Ittner's presentations. Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course. Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content. I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching. If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating. Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating. But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy. You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost. Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through. While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching. And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers. I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher. There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here. ""I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to"" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're ""stocked"" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that ""we're going to run some narly regressions"", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants. These segments add absolutely zero value. They lengthen the time of the course. To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together.",1

I was eager to learn screenwriting as an interesting hands-on course. Well, it's project-based alright, but where's the real guidance??This is a lazily designed course with poor content and almost zero guidance. The videos are very short and feels like a layman is trying to motivate you to write something, that's all. No methods explained other than some terminologies like bible, acts, outline being thrown at you. No examples, no comparisons, no detailed approaches.Lastly, scriptwriting has a significant difference with other humanities course.

Actually you could even skip this specialization since they canceled the capstone project so investing any money and time here is a waste. I can only recommend this specialization/course IF the instructors add a project at the end , be more involved on the forums , update non functional links ,and finally USE NON PROPRIETARY libraries hence they will need to take feedback from the students and redo most components of this specialization.",1

87018,"Unfortunately on the whole I was very disappointed with this class. I took the first two Python courses and found them manageable, but this third one was an unrealistic increase in difficulty from the previous two. I reached out for help on the discussion board a number of times and saw many others were struggling as well. Mentors who responded to some of the other students were clearly getting defensive when those students were getting nowhere on the assignments. I think this program should reevaluate itself so students such as me can keep up with the assignments. On average I was spending about 10 hours per week just on the syntax for building the programs.A little about my background: I have 20 years of experience in the private sector and am currently an analyst in cyber security. I have an undergraduate degree in finance, an MBA, and another master’s degree in Data Analytics. This 5 course program has been described and sold as beginner level, and given my background I should have handily been able to complete it, but that was definitely not the case. Normally I don’t leave feedback unless I feel strongly about something, so I hope you take it seriously. Thanks.",1
89086,"I didn't find the overall content of the course very well chosen for an introduction to philosophy - since it covers so little. The title of this course should have been ""An Introduction to Just a Couple of Topics in Philosophy."" And there are so few philosophers covered. However, the biggest problem was instructorAlasdair Richmond, whose response to debate was locking threads down every time his ideological positions were challenged. He showed himself completely inept to have a debate with more than one course participant and chose to censor a variety of viewpoints he dislikes. It was particularly ironic to see an instructor exercise censorship in a Philosophy course - a domain whose objective, after all, is the pursuit of truth as well as to ask and debate the ""why"" of everything! A petty tyrant does not make a good teacher.Should I ever meet anyone interested in studying Philosophy, my first recommendation to them will be stay away from the University of Edinburgh, since there is no respect for debate, freedom of expression, or inquiry there.",1

103953,"I'm dropping this course because it's just SO poorly conceived. Three weeks in, and I can't really articulate what I've actually learned (which leads me to believe that the answer is ""not very much""). The major problem is that this course has no clear objective. And I don't mean that the individual lessons don't have objectives - I actually mean that the entire course doesn't know what it wants to be and the instructors seem to have bypassed this critical question. I have a background in Python, and I was under the impression that this course would teach me how to program in Swift (seems like a fairly straightforward goal). But it isn't that at all. If I were to summarize this course (perhaps a little uncharitably, because I'm annoyed at the time I wasted) it would be: some dudes with a computer talk about some cool features of a programming language. I'm fairly baffled by the fact that there was no thought put into which examples might best illustrate the features they were trying to teach. Which-examples-might-best-illustrate-the-feature-I-am-trying-to-teach is pedagogy 101. They would regularly work through examples just to conclude ""actually that's a bad example"". This is pretty strong evidence that there was no lesson planning involved. There were also no practice exercises, no posting of pieces of illustrative code, and hence, no way to actually get good at programming in Swift (unless it's self directed, in which case - why bother with the formality of taking a course on Coursera?).",1

6078,"Why is this course dangerous?I took this course because first I liked the idea to have a history lesson spanning the age of the whole universe. Maybe it is also intriguing to explain everything just with one principle: the second law of thermodynamics. BUT as it turned out they don't have any clue what this second law of thermodynamics means. They always forget the second part of it: it is just valide in a closed system. I think everbody will agree, that the earth for example isn't a closed system.In the beginning they tell you you should be critical about everything new you hear or get taught. But if you are critical and question things they teach you they will ignore you. One glance at the discussion forum shows: they are fast in answering good feedback and compliments by students, but critical questions (with scientific papers who show different facts) get ignored for weeks and months. They are cherry picking. They just see what encourages their view and their opinion and ignore everything that contradicts their course, opinion, believe and dogma. In this respect they are so dangerous. That is the same principle how cults work.Maybe their goal, stopping polluting and changing the world in such a speed seems to be a good one. But also here you have to be careful. When they talk about climate change and the overuse of ressources they are exaggerating by a factor of 50! In my opinion you are damaging an important discussion if you are lying and exaggerating in such a shameless way. For sure it is not helpful! But again, the truth doesn't fit in their world view.Furthermore they ""teach"" that cities get blown away by taifoons is caused by the ""universe balancing entropy"". This isn't just lack of understanding physics, or history, or flow mechanics, it is just insane.In summary: this is not a history course, but the ""teachings"" of a lying, exaggerating, cherry picking cult with no knowledge in particle physics, cosmology, chemistry, biology or even history.So please: if you take this course, be aware of this pitfalls and their intentions.",1

So not only did I not feel like I was doing the work correctly, I can't get feedback, and the lecturer doesn't break down the rationale behind the assignment, and how he would have done it or why. In addition, the assignments bear only a tangential relationship to the lecture material. So I would be feeling good coming out of a lecture and going through swirl exercises, only to be plunged into a programming assignment that was far too advanced for the small steps I felt I had taken in my overall competence with the language and material.I don't doubt that someone with better knowledge of programming can get through this stuff, but this class should be reserved for advanced learners only, or maybe be broken up into two courses.

My suggestion for the instructor: redo your lecture slides or point out to all of the errors in the slides. It is not acceptable for you to just say that they contain errors and not point out where all of the errors in the slides are. You only pointed out to one error in the slides by the way.

This assignment deals with functions, where the code is complicated. What's unfortunate is that you have to finish ever assignment, including this impossible assignment (for beginners) to get recognition for the course. I spent most of my time researching other sources for information because the lectures, and the supplemental information given on a different site, by the instructor (which indicate knowledge that the lectures are insufficient) give trivial examples when the programming assignments are anything but.

94658,"This is the worst course online I've done so far. I would not recommend it to anyone as it stands, regardless of the student's background, this course is just poor and lacking.The premise of this course is a promising one, the topic is still in its infancy and seems very interesting. Having said that, this is about everything positive that I can say about this course.For starters, the videos seem good at first, but later it becomes very superficial and monotone. The content is many times just rushed through and it's visible that the lecturers at several occasions have difficulty even to read their own slides!However, the worst part of the course are the quizzes. There are 24 graded quizzes in total, to pass the course you need to pass all 24 of them! To make matters worse, the minimum passing marks for each quiz is 80%, that wouldn't have been such an issue if most quizzes had 5 or more questions, which is not the case, most of the quizzes have 4 or less questions. This is such an unreasonable requirement, if you miss only one question in a quiz with 3 questions there's already no chance to pass the course!The content of each quiz is also very troublesome, we are essentially being graded for trivia, a considerable number of the questions are very superficially related to not related at all to the subject of each lecture. Instead of using the questions to delve deeper into the topic at hand, they only create confusion with futilities. A little example, the topic of a subject was about the mechanical properties of using multiple templates and a question in its quiz was about an electric circuit that is never shown in the question itself, only briefly shown in the lecture video for about 10s, minimal information is given without any explanation of what they mean and we are asked to enter a formula as the answer for which also almost no information is given about which notation we should use for the formula itself.There are other cases where there are multiple choice questions which have incorrect answers accepted by the grader. In one instance, two of the options available are contradictory to each other, however the accepted answer was the one involving both. In another instance, there was more than one solution available to an answer, however the grader accepted only one and there was no information in the question itself to narrow down the possible answers to the desired one.Finally, there is no active community by the TA and professors, I have never had a single answer form a TA or professor, only sporadical replies from a mentor, who has no authority to fix any issue by him or herself.All these issues just point to how poorly this course was designed. It had such high hopes, but they fell short flat. In doing this course, I found myself reverse engineering most of the questions just to try to find an accepted answer and try to understand what it meant. The imposed 8-hour period between attempts at the quizzes only hindered my progress. I was focused and engaged in studying for each quiz, however, after 3 failed attempts I had an imposed break period that makes little sense. In the end, this course only made me feel like the very object of my learning: a robot.I am really disappointed with this course.",1

Also, there are over 3 hours of videos in the 1st week plus 3 quizzes and a programming assignment.

The creators of this course did not react to our cries of help within a week. Poor support from them - the coursera team tried to help but obviously in vain. What I learnt for future courses: I will look into the detail of every assingment before starting and paying. Unfortunately in some courses you can´t even look into the assignments when you haven´t paid. This should be changed. Because I consider it a trick to lure someone into an interesting course and then making it impossible to finish it in the given timeframe. Not being able to see what will be demanded prior to paying may also be a coursera policy problem. So maybe there is a better platform than coursera that lets you to be clear of what is ahead of you.

It was necessary to use a collection of outside material from other courses and readings to learn the concepts. This course needs to be completely redone with a focus on developing a student's intuition for the material and then support this intuition with basic examples that build as the course progresses. A fundamental demonstration of how to use R to work through regression models (starting from square one) should be added so that this becomes a self-contained course.

Earlier I have also read that we would be allowed to build an app of our choice or according to teacher's specification. That text now seems to have been removed.Anyway, none of these promises were kept. Instead we got something like 20 minutes of lectures in total for the whole four weeks, all on a simple framework to track face features. Unfortunately this framework isn't very competent, so there's only so much you can do with it. Most of us have only placed some static images and simple animations on top of the face shown in the camera view, and that is actually enough to get full marks according to the form used in the peer review. How does that even begin to fulfil the promises of the caption?We have paid as much for this course as for the previous three. There should of course be a similar amount of lectures on more advanced topics like current best practises for UI design, the Location API which was promised, and other interesting things that provide the building blocks for a state of the art iOS app. For a real cornerstone project, I expect that more than 4 weeks would be necessary in order to be able to build a good app, since many of us are doing this on our spare time.I feel sad that I had the misfortune of signing up for this course before it was made, but hope that you will take our collective criticism and make a good course out of this for future students.",1

Refunded after scoring 100% on first three weeks and watching the theory portion of week 4. I was familiar, with the subject prior to taking this course; was hoping for a deep dive.Too many trivially short and low information density videos. Handwavy mathematics. I would have liked to get a more solid idea of the depth of the series from the first course before committing money.Default software for the course has near-zero market penetration (per indeed.com), unless maybe you work at Apple -- not really excusable for something that purports real-world value. Yes, you can use other software, *except for the capstone*, per another reviewer: this is fatal.Presenters just not fully prepared to lecture on the topic: the nail in the coffin was the end of the week 4 lectures on clustering: ""So, at this point, you really should be able to go out there and build a really cool retrieval system for doing news article retrieval. Or any other really, really, really cool retrieval that I can't think of right now. But of course there's lots of interesting examples. So go out there and think of ideas that I can't think of right now."" Really? How about: ""Cut! Take two.""Many poor design choices for the presentation. Too much time spent writing things on slides that should have already been on the slides.As of this review: no reviews on the last courses in the series, and some poor (but indicative) reviews of the other courses.",1

85485,"I did all four courses - the whole specialization. Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things. However, the course certificate is meaningless. It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours). Instead, it even says ""non-credit course"".

How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?",1

I mean, professors in that course are presenting their own research! Cade Massey presents research he did with Dick Thaler! None of that happens here. The information shared doesn't even flow smoothly.This course relies mainly on PDF slides (if I wanted to read, I would've bought a book). At one point, it even links to 6 articles on another website (and that's in the quiz as well). It seems like very little effort was put into this online class by the professors. The slides themselves seemed scatter-brained, several times asking questions that are never even answered. It was almost as if someone took already prepared slides from a course and just kind of mashed them with a very little bit of video to make an ""online"" course. Even the answers to quizzes seemed extremely vague (it often felt like there were several right answers... or none -- to me, this is sloppy quiz writing).I honestly expected better from both Coursera and Duke!

Digital marketing has barely made a dent in their revenues.Technology products don't follow this model.Another annoying aspect of this course is that things are not well defined so they can't be applied. ""customer co-creation"" is presented as a ground breaking idea but it is defined so vaguely. The definition states that customer co-creation is any contribution by a customer or otherwise that helps shape the products. What is considered contribution? Is product feedback contribution? If so, this idea is as old as a Bazaar. Or does the customer actually have to do creative work, in the case of Threadless.The big problem with this course is that it does not introduce the student to any new mental frameworks, leave alone anything practical. This course is a prime example of academiaitis - ideas created in ivory towers without any practical input or use.",1

The assignments are relatively hard in that you don't get all the necessary info from the course, sometimes even R's own manpages aren't enough.

After taking the next course, I see that it is possible to deliver a lot of material and concepts in short order. However, it takes thinking, planning, and dedication. I think this course is TERRIBLE and seriously needs an overhaul. After taking this course, you barely know any CSS and despite passing assignments that don't challenge, you're probably worse off than a student who fails in school.The course suffers from the extremely short timeframe. Covering one of each of the three core topics a week is just insufficient to provide any sort of depth to this course.

There was not enough further reading and no discussion of other people's work - such as a dissection of how a company might have arrived at a product we can actually identify in the wild.Rather than learning how I could tackle any project, I now know how to work on very specific examples of projects - if anything was to deviate from this, I'd still be clueless.Overall, the course feels haphazard and badly prepared.",1

Your classmates with experience in adobe are scoring you based upon the instructors ""excellent"" examples. Not realistic at all.I would also point out that the course is excellent for journalists but completely useless for those of us in the business world.

Evaluation seems to be based solely on peer review and there are no model solutions available, so the points you'll get may vary depending on how your peers understood the assignment and if they were interested in the review process at all.My overall feeling is that nothing was quite challenging on the course, and I didn't learn much more than what I could have learnt by reading a few paragraphs per topic from Wikipedia. I also felt that the programming assignments were quite disjoint from the core, tough I don't feel like I understand the core better than before the course because none of the assignments made me think why something works, rather than that we just mechanically reproduced the examples shown in the lectures.",2
4250,All theory. Quizzes you were left with the task of answering questions based on models never seen or explained spent most time trying to make sense of them. Final project is almost a joke to try and decipher how to create from scratch based on the ones they provided in the quizzes. Its not a joke but it is very difficult when the actual excel and model making isnt part of the lectures.,2

Further, the content in the lessons does not even show or explain what is expected from the learning.I spent the majority of my time exploring the discussions to discover what I was supposed to be doing and the rest of it on Google teaching myself the concepts that were not taught in the course.",2
40534,"The material is very interesting. There a a huge number of quizzes over poorly explained (or not at all explained) models, which would still be an interesting challenge if the models themselves had better explanations.

106065,"I was very disaappointed by this course, in fact a bit more so than by the ""Unwritten"" course that has run concurrently with this one. I was **very** put off by the professor's simply opening his book and trying to remember what he'd said there and then, in front of his audience, reduce it down to a videoed talk. He needed to put some effort and thought into understanding his topic from the point of view of an audience that is inevitably very, very different from the one he had in mind (if any, in particular) as he was writing the book. If he didn't have time for proper preparation, he should have found another medium for flogging his publications.By and large, everyone who is from the US (I'm not) and who teaches about the US constitution emphasizes its uniqueness. Indeed, they have a point: it was the first (and, admirably, the shortest) modern written constitution. However, uniqueness isn't unique among nations; all nations are somehow unique. Undertanding a nation (including thir constitution) has to involve looking at both hum-drum normality as well as uniqueness. I felt that the course would have been more substantial if it had been built on the obvious fact that the US revolutionaries were ""Englishmen fighting for an Englishman's rights."" And, indeed, what they created had both the worst and the best traits that England's historical jurisprudence offered. Social stare decisis has been a major stumbling-block not only for common-law countries but as well for countries that follow other sorts of jurisprudence.The course was embarrassingly bad.",2

The course on nutrition is just ""ok"" but the teacher has a very skewed idea about what ""healthy cooking"" really is and fails to present with reasons for her recipe choices.Anyway I stopped watching the course, again, the nutritional part is fairly good but if you choose to continue the course at least make sure you keep searching for other points of view as well.Best of luck.",2
95200,"Overall, this course is tough for me. In my opinion, the course title is not suitable, which is ""introduction"". The word ""introduction"" generally means something basic and fundamental. However, the level programming assignments in this course is between slightly medium and very hard.Furthermore, the assignment instructions are not clear enough, i.e. what steps need to be followed to complete each question. So, it needs time for me to find the way or solution in the discussion forum. I know in each week forum, there is one discussion specifically for assignment (i.e. Assignment X Tips), which is good. But, I think the forum is not a good place, since we have to find it meticulously the information and what we want to find is spread out, not in an easy to follow order.Moreover, I do not think the lectures and the assignments are well synchronized as there are many things in assignments that are outside from the lectures. I mean, it is ""too many"" new things in the assignment. Although it is a great way for the students to search and enhance their skills by themselves, in general, the assignments should at least reflect the lectures.Lastly, in my humble opinion, this course is not appropriate for someone who is new to programming and has not been familiar or mastered any programming languages, though the title is ""introduction"".",2

Also, there are misspellings in the quizzes. Finally, one quiz marked a question wrong and then, in the comments, noted the answer was right.Further, some of the videos seem to stretch out information to fill time.",2

It's all about advertizing: Emily Fox can't stop but recommend Amazon services, and Carlos Guestrin does the same for his Dato's Graphlab Create, which is might be great in general, but absolutely useless in educational purposes. The practice part of every week is just a waste of the time.I can't say ""money well spent"".",2

Here are my complaints:-Much of the more interesting bits say ""check out this other course in bioinformatics for details"". Of course, if you aren't registered for that other course, you don't have access to those materials.-Not a lot of thought went into the homeworks. All of them are ""implement this. Here is some pseudocode"", with no ""think about a problem that can be solved with the same ideas"", like the other courses in the specialization (which are, in my opinion, much better).-We saw 4 algorithms for string matching (KMP, Rabin-Karp, suffix array matching, Burrow-Wheeler's transform), but virtually no discussion on when to use each one, strengths and weaknesses, and so on. Also, no Boyer-Moore?-After passing all test cases for a homework, we should be able to download a solution with the correct implementation, in order to improve our own.",2
93242,There are huge gaps between learning materials (videos) and assignments. Assignments are very difficult and definitely not for R beginners. Also assignments' instruction are a little difficult to understand. I wonder if the purpose of assignments is to exam our reading and understanding abilities or the skills of R!!!I also took courses <Getting and Cleaning Data> and <Exploratory Data Analysis> at the same time and these two courses' assignments are much easier than the course <R Programming>. Writing function in R really isn't that easy especially for an R beginner who only has little knowledge of R packages and functions. I really don't think this course should arrange as the second course to take in this Data Science course series.,2

Ilkay Altintas, who is the main lecturer, is a sweet woman, but lecturing from a manuscript is not her strongest side. It is clear that she is reading from a screen while she is looking into the camera. Anyone could do that job, and they should have chosen more of an ""news anchor"" type of person with better pronunciation and more flow. It's simply very uninspiring and boring to listen to. Also, 59 dollars is far too expensive for such a short course.",2

After I finished all the modules of this course, always coding along the lectures and having done all the assignments to practice and having read the extra material, by the end of this course I didn't had a solid foundation about how to program in JavaScript. So, if you enrolled the Web Design Specialization, after the HTML & CSS's courses you will have solid foundation about those languages, you will also grasp the basics of Responsive Design course but you will have to do other JavaScript courses to became a Junior Front-End Developer in the ""real life"".",2

If you don't have the skills to complete this course, you will not complete this course. The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skills required to complete the assignments.I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Bill's colleagues) at University of Washington. That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments (though still very challenging).",2
4318,"PROS:- Classification lecture is good;-Weekly assignments are challenging enoughCONS- No slides provided. Professor draws on an eletronic chalkboard (with a very bad handwriting) and you need to keep going back to videos when you are doing the homework. For me, this shows lack of professionalism and laziness- Some excel sheets are provided. But they are very messy and badly formatted, matching the messy handwriting in the videos. AND, the instructions are for MAC! No instructions for PC are provided whatsoever. I never used MAC, so I had a very hard time!- Very few examples real examples are provided;- You learn math concepts, not Excel skills! Except for the LINEST function, which is very handy, BUT it's NOT TAUGHT in the videos. I had to google the function to learn it.- They say to complete each piece of the final assingment after you finish the respective week related to that piece. But they only say that as you start week 6!- The course doesn't provide sufficient material for the final assignment. You get stuck without knowing how to get to answers;- Some answers to the final assignment are not correct, you check the answer sheet, and the results aren't present in the test!OVERALL:I'd never recommend this course to anyone. I only took it because I'm plannening to finish the specialization.I've taken several Online Courses (5+ on Excel), and this is the worst and most frustating one by far!",2

I would need a few example calculations of similar problems to what we are expected to solve in the exercises.As a result, my learning success is not very satisfactory.",2
69199,"This course (as the previous one) needs some improvements. First learning only relying on videos is not very effective. There are no lecture slides neither consistent addtional resources to grasp seriously the materials. Also the way quizzes are designed is not - in my opinion, very well planned. The videos alone do not give consistent background to approach seriously the quizzes. Also - again in my opinion, I didn't saw a consistent approach to the materials, neither the examples given made any sense. In the last video, there is a mention to the business world and how to apply this savoir relier approach, but in contrast the videos and examples show as examples a situation extreme with an avalanche, use the HEC MBA program as example. I simply don't see how this can relate with the business world as a consistent comparison. I think you should reflect on this.",2

I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly ""this is for the experts in linear algebra"". Come on! If one is taking a machine learning course, one can expect more from the students. Otherwise the course ends up being a flaky tap-dance on the surface of the material.",2
52127,"There is quality implicit in the approach taken, but in my opinion, this course is excessively short, having only 20-25 minutes of videos per week, what is very limiting. Also there is no slides of the material covered what I find not adequate. To fully grasp the theories underlyind in the lectures, slides would be determinant. Just watching videos and doing quizzes is not a very effective form of learning.",2

9022,"I must say that the Capstone Project was a good assignment. The issue is that the Peer Reviews were bad. I had to resubmit my assignment due to a student that choose to give me 0's when the other reviewers gave me 5's. There was also a bias to what each reviewer thought the capstone should cover so you had no idea which direction to update your work because the next reviewer may feel that the type of analysis you did was not Necessary.The course needs a specific Rubric and specific methods each person has to use in order to complete the assignment. For example, Must Use the Four Forces Model when evaluating Strategy. This way everyone knows what to expect and what to look for. Otherwise you can get a low grade on a great project because a Classmate thought you should have used another model so he gave you a 1 or 0 when the model you used demonstrated your knowledge.Capstones need to be monitored either by a student or assistant to protect against trolls that don't read your work and give you the lowest score. Otherwise the Course was great and the information was definitely well put together. The Peer Reviews brought my overall grade lower because I didn't get the High Mark I should have.",2

5909,"Algorithmic Toolbox consists of a series of slides containing slimmed down explanations on introductory algorithmic concepts, followed up with programming assignments. The slides are the centrepiece of the course, as the presenters rarely stray from the bullet points and pseudocode they're comprised of.I learned a lot during this course. Although, to gain confidence in your knowledge, this is a course that will require you to seek out additional materials to supplement your learning. Perhaps unsurprising being an introductory course, but the presenters struggle when faced with setting expectations.Throughout the course presenters often gloss over fairly complex concepts, treating them as they were trivial knowledge. This applies to mathematical definitions, proofs where most steps are skipped, tree diagrams without the context of their underlying theory, or bullet points used in place of what could be detailed explanations.All material is left equally weighted. Rather than providing explanations like: ""We don't need to go into detail on this, only x concept from it is important for what we want to focus on. Reference this chapter in this book for more detail."" presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim from the slides and move on. I was often unsure of how much I would need to know about such concepts.In terms of communication ability, the presenters don't hold up against many of the free/low-cost services I'm accustomed to using, for example: MIT OpenCourseWare, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, Code School, Treehouse, etc. Perhaps unsurprising, as these competing services often feature professional communicators rather than professional researchers. But the marketplace for quality online education is definitely becoming a competitive one. Users now expect nothing less than presenters with exceptional communication/teaching ability.In most videos the presenters read verbatim from the slides and motion with their hands to explain concepts that would be better broken down on a whiteboard. Rarely straying from the slides, the times the presenters go into more depth on a concept, you get a scribble in the corner of a slide, lacking the clarity I've come to expect when approaching complex concepts from master educators like YouTuber PatrickJMT or Khan Academy. After a couple weeks into the course, I just went straight to the slides, read MIT's Introduction to Algorithms, and skipped most of the course videos.But all things considered, the course served as a good curriculum to guide my focus through the introductory concepts, regardless of where I sought it out.",2

No functional examples are provided in the lectures and the real learning content is linked out to web resources. You will have to Google your way through this class because the provided instruction will not contain answers to the quiz or exam questions. A real disappointment.I also think that Coursera knows this, because this was the first course where they ramped up the e-mail encouragement campaign. Their data must tell them this is where people fall off the specialization. Rather than addressing with marketing and messaging, they should encourage the instructors to improve the course.",2

Of course the course isn't responsible for this, but an appropriate name would fix that.Throughout the course, the quizzes were entertaining - but the quality of the questions is questionable. Sometimes the answer is obvious because the other answers are ridiculous, sometimes you don't know what to click, even though you just watched the video carefully. Reason for this is that there are questions being asked, which weren't even touched in the lesson.It's basically the same with the last assignment - you can watch and do all the lessons before, you've got no idea how to start and what to do as there's simply no explanation of what affects what - which seems to be extremely important in javascript. Yes, it's often told in an overview-style explanation what a function is doing, but something in depth that tells you how to write working javascript functions is lacking.The quality of the explanations also varied in their quality. Some things that were pretty easy to understand, were explained over 10 very boring minutes, other things that were far more complex and tricky, were handled in half a minute. This made watching the videos frustrating at times. I'm not sure which kind of audience this course is supposed for, but the style varies way too much.Furthermore it's great that coursera is offering an iPad-app, but I'd like to be able to use and do everything that the app is offering me (and in the best case: everything that's necessary for the course). I can't even review classmates, as they're uploading .rar or .zip-files, which can't be accessed via iPad, and also javascript is a problem for ipads.

The intro video and course introduction strongly suggested using deep learning in the course: did not happen. We trained k-means on pre-computed features which happened to come from from a deep learning network (not sure which one, inception? I didn't even watch the lectures here from disappointment). That is not deep learning, it just shows you how well deep learning can work.Graphlab is a mature framework, I guess, but it's commercial and scikit-learn is better imho (and free!).If you wish to learn machine learning, take the Stanford course on Machine Learning for Andrew Ng. This course is in MATLAB, not ideal for machine learning, but adequate for a better understanding of intelligent system implementations.Maybe the course is OK if you're a beginner in machine learning, but not good.",2
81399,"I just finished this course. I want to give a frank feedback since I see a lot of untapped possibilities in this course. On the strengths, it began with a high note and got me glued with expectations and promises. The instructor sounded extremely comfortable and confident with her subject, and had a very calming and pleasant presence which helped establish a kind of ""remote"" trust. On the improvement areas, I however have a few to list. For one, the intensity, rigour and to-the-pointedness of the content sharply fell after the first week. Having known about mindfulness, Metta meditations, gratitude, it became personally disappointing to me how this course conveyed so little about them and impacted so less than can be possible with the time and space alloted. The framework which initially looked hopeful is perhaps not the best framework, as much as is said about this not being ""spectator course"". Because this format diluted the intensity and possibility of the course, making it drag and bore towards the end. I wish there were guest interviews of more experienced academicians than what happened here as interviews from which there was little to learn. Honestly, this is my 4th of 5th course on positive psychology and this one will have to make many a fixes to any other that I've taken on coursera. The course ended and I find myself not a tad upbeater or nourished, or knowing something useful that I did not know already other than about vegas nerves which really did not make sense to end user who are here to know what and how to do things and feel better.",2

The material is quite short: only 30 minutes of videos every week and no interviews with ""real-life"" managers.The additional articles to read most relate to blue-chip companies that succeeded: Samsung, Toyota, Netflix, Google, and of course the obligatory Apple mentioned in every Strategy course on the planet. However, it would be much more interesting to discuss failures and/or duller companies.Finally, the final peer-review exercise is a bit broken but that is the case of every MOOC peer-graded approach (cf. https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/problems-peer-grading-coursera to know more).On the upside, videos are well edited and clear and easy to understand.",2

103799,"The video materials were very poor, they did not cover all the aspects and the explanations were very brief. The course only contained a single project, which although fun, is not enough for learning a new language. After completing this course I feel that I don't really know Swift, but I can use it. After each week you have to complete a quiz. They should replace these quizzes with project, where you write real code. I took this course for free, but I wouldn't pay for it.",2
103853,"Having completed the assignment after many hours of trial & error; here are some suggestions for improving the class for future sessions.Increase the length and depth of the lectures so that more of the materials needed for the assignment are covered.For each week, have an optional programming exercise (not graded) but with a model answer (with explanations of why) so that students have a concrete example on which to practice key concepts on.As classes & structs are very important to completing the assignment (instead of just including the SWIFT manual chapter on classes & structs in the Follow Up Reading), include an actual lecture about this topic.Improve the description of the assignment to be completed. Be specific about what is required (e.g.; what does interface mean? Is is a User interface or is just a specified variable which can be changed in the program code? What do you mean by order of applying filters? Do you mean a variable which lets you decide order of filters and executes the filters accordingly or does the ability to manually rearranging the order of the calling of functions in the code suffice?)Improve the alignment between the assignment and the review criteria. The assignment asks for FIVE filters but there is no matching criterion in the review criteria. Based on the current review criteria, creating two filters would suffice to demonstrate ability to order and get full points for varying intensity for more than 1 filter.I hope the remainder of the modules are better otherwise I will be extremely disappointed !",2

The course videos are sometimes kind of less engaging. Many a times I felt my interest waning off. Many a times, the mathematical equations looked daunting. I think more focus should be put on including more number of real world examples and solving them within the videos.Also, the concept of three Professors for one course was hard to digest, which led to the whole course feeling discontinuous and disconnected at several instances.",2

It is as if I dropped into a void.I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution, questions or help.I would NOT recommend taking this course and would better advise you to find something in another online teaching program or course within Coursera that has at least a modicum of personal interaction.",2

They are covering the similar topics but this class has fallen short on most of the subject.Lecture time is very little. Short videos, and few of them. Each video is mostly non-focused talking, very few examples and so you don't learn much.By comparison, the other class has a lot of videos, each video is much longer and goes into many examples. Time is spent on focusing on the things to learn, and you get a lot out of it.I am dropping out of this specialization and will follow the other one which I hope will bring good content (unfortunately the following classes are not from the same teacher but from the same university). The following classes from this specialization are from the same teacher, so I don't think things will improve much.",2

100348,"Some things are useful, such as the table ""task list"", but I would say there isn't enough of this type of help. It would be better if there were more tables like that.Also, more information and help is needed on how to accomplish multitasking. Unfortunately, multitasking is necessary in many environments, from office to home, and even a housewife has to multitask. One of the most important aspects of multitasking that was not covered and that is really needed is how to multitask in a situation of ""housewife"" type of work. Examples of this include engineering, molecular biology, chemistry, work in a lab in general etc. You constantly need, like a housewife, put something for a chemical reaction (or start laundry, or put a cake in the oven), and then you have to wait for the chemical reaction to occur. And during that time when you wait, you need to keep this ongoing ""laundry"" task in your head, so that you don't forget to take it out later on time. And when there are more than 3-4 tasks like that, and they all have this ""pick me up and start on me later"" thing, they are all in your head and they take up all your memory and resources. And the worst part is, it's difficult to schedule them, because you need to schedule not how long will something take, not in a linear fashion, but how long will multiple parallel things take. I would really appreciate it if there was something about this topic in a time management course.",2
93999,"There were some real technical problems in this course. The video sound wouldn't match up in places, and the brief questions inserted into the video would come prior to us learning the content to answer the question. In addition the quiz answers would not match up to what was learned in the video. For example, one quiz asked what type of question would ""tell me about a time"" be, and in the video it literally said it was a behavioral question, but that was marked wrong in the quiz. There were also several instances where the percentages taught to us were marked wrong in the quiz. This was not as high of a quality learning experience as the first course in the specialization, so I was quite disappointed. I do hope someone will go through this course and fix the inconsistencies and technical errors. Thank you.",2
18675,"I's not exactly class for the beginners. First half covers HTML and CSS and quite understandable and easy. Although, it might also help that I had class completely on HTML and CSS in the past, so I actually know what to do to write necessary code. The second part is on JavaScript. And here is where problem starts (at least for me). I didn't take JavaScript class in the past and it was all new for me. Professors try to explain it in few lectures 10-15 minutes each and then they expect you to write couple of programs and to make some project from scratch in few days. Sorry, maybe it's just me, but I got to have much more then about an hour of explanation to do so. I would highly recommend anyone who is new to JavaScript to take JavaScript class first and then to start this one. And no, I'm not new to programming.",2

However, there are some issues concerning the assignments which I didn't like at all:1. Big gap in difficulty between assignments of first three weeks compared with the assignment of the fourth week.2. The difficulty of the assignments of the first three weeks just relied on sweeping (somewhat 'smartly') a 1,2,3, or 6 dimensional parametric space. I guess that real UAVs engineers are not paid for this. In some assignment, I had to edited a file which I was not supposed to edit in order to pass it.3. The last assignment was quite frustrating for the following reasons3a. Really long running times to test if the parameters work fine. I would sacrifice the fancy real-time visualization to save some time. Apart from long running times, I guess that UAVs are not solving ODEs in real time on board, so I think is more interesting a more practical/real-time approach.3b. Search in a 12-dimensional parametric space (some parameters are equal, but still you end up tunning 5,6 independent parameters, which influence each other). Come on, is this useful? I am sure that UAVs engineers don't spend their hours in this kind of crappy search. You could explain at least some existing heuristics when having so many control parameters to tune.3c. Even though the drone trajectory seems to fit perfectly the planned trajectory, you might not pass the exercise, and you would get some clueless messages telling you the final position/velocity is not correct.3d. The assignment guide is very unclear in some parts.3e. A lot of typos in the formulas of the last part of the guide. I decided to completely ignore it and develop my own strategy, which turned out to be far simpler and easier to implement.3f.

Why do we have to do so many code reviews? Not every assignment requires people's coding style to be evaluated. It places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student. Its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated. We should be learning about Android for 4 more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for 4 more hours.The thing I found most frustrating is that the assignments are trying to force a particular coding style on everyone. Since I am an experienced programmer, I understand the importance of coding style, creating functions and all that. However, how I structure my code and how many comments I write are entirely my choice.Now, while I understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another; the review guidelines that are being given to some very inexperienced programmers, makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done.

17321,"This course, which sounds promising in title and syllabus, has many glaring deficiencies. In fact, I feel terrible if anyone ponied up $100+ for it. It roughly covers some concepts of data science, but never at scale, and never very clearly. My background is a science Ph.D. with a lot of computational science experience.The lectures: Clearly poorly planned. Bill Howe has some knowledge about databases, but little skill in communicating it. The organizational structure leaves much to be desired. Much of the lectures are broad-brush and halting, simultaneously being too detailed as times and not broad enough at other times. Technical portions are marked by a number of errors in speaking and on the slides, as well as a lot of hesitation and jargon. It's as if he neither thought about the structure of what he wanted to say or a script of what he might say prior to recoding the session. Phoning in it is an apt description.The Assignments: The first assignment with Twitter was fun and interesting and gets the course 2 stars instead of one. The lectures prior to this will not prepare you for the assignment though, so might as well just skip them and do it on your own. The SQL assignment followed a set of lectures in which no proper discussion of SQL was ever given. The last assignment on Map-Reduce is acceptable although a number of errors in the homeworks are still uncorrected long after the first offering of this course. The autograder's idea of helpful feedback is similar to ""Incorrect value. Try again"" Week 4 of this course, which contains a vast amount of information has no exercises at all.Overall, this class is the polar opposite of a quality online course like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course.

I'm not even sure how the smartphone components fit together, or what they actually do.It would be a really interesting course if there were more examples, such as how smartphone components work together or a deeper comparison between the iOS and Android systems is used when discussing the development timeline of each model, instead of pure cognitive knowledge being read from a slide.Maybe these concepts are explored further in the other courses for this certificate, but as a stand alone introduction to smartphone technologies the information is poorly imparted.",2

Other than swirl, it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before. I worked hard to be able to follow it, but if I knew how uninvolved the instructors were, I would have saved my money and spent it on a course with active involvement from those who developed it. Disappointing.",2
104938,There are better courses on the subject on coursera and other platforms. It worth it pursuing it if you are interested in joining the capstone project.,2
93443,"This is not a course for a beginner in programming. If you are interested in learning R, I would recommend going to DataCamp and starting there. The lecture videos were not engaging, and the jump from the lecture and quizzes to the programming assignments was quite significant (as others have pointed out). The lecturer for this course does have a pre-programming assignment on his GitHub repository to aid in the first programming assignment, but this was not easy to locate nor advertised well (had to scroll through discussion forums before I saw someone mention it). The swirl assignments were the only saving grace for a class that was otherwise not engaging or structured well. The class could stand to be restructured: for example, it would have been nice for the lectures to cover the str() function before our first programming assignment. Overall, this class does seem to be a good choice for a ""refresher"" course if you already have some experience coding in R, but be wary if you have little to no programming experience.",2

I like Dr.Chuck courses, especially 2-4 in this specialization, but this course has no programming challenge and check only your ability to make screenshots. If you have any programming experience you don't need this course it doesn't pay off your time you spend for this. Sorry again, but it's my opinion.",2

69089,It really just touches a lot on different machine learning techniques and really just sets the stage for the higher courses. Unfortunately some of the chapters (especially deep learning) are so brief that it is really frustrating trying to complete the quiz and assignment. Also the course doesn't use open source tools but a trial version of a pretty expensive library.,2
95057,"Thanks for the course. A few things that can be improved:1- The video material was very short. I expected same amount of teaching like homework, but it's more like 30 minutes versus 7 hours every week. As a result it's mostly googling and copy-pasting code, which I'm very sceptical if solving issues this way will enter my long-term memory. Probably next time I will need to look it up again. I'd prefer if the videos were the source of knowledge instead of stack overflow and the forum.2 - As an experienced programmer but being new to Python I found it difficult to load the data. I was not aware that the files are available on the server and can just be loaded by read_csv(filename.csv). Instead I tried to load the files from my local drive, which worked, but not for the grader. Then I tried to submit it offline which also failed. I wasted half a day on this. I suggest to mention quickly how the online and offline assignments work, in particular in how to load data.3 - The feedback from the grader is usually not telling much. It was often unclear to me what was the expected outcome. I think a screenshot of the expected answer for the more advanced questions (first few rows+columns) would help a lot and save us a lot of suffering.",2

I am currently learning to program python and a lot of this stuff was well above my head.The quizzes and assignments do very little to reinforce the work, and often come down to trial and error. I wanted to learn the mechanics of machine learning from this course, but it is too complex, and presented in such an arcane manner to serve as an introduction, but doesn't go deep enough to really teach anything useful. I'd suggest you look at Wikipedia or YouTube for better classes.I'd like to draw special attention to the quizzes, as often they're on trivia from the lectures and not reflective of the actual nuts and bolts of working with machine learning. They, as with the projects, I found to be a massive waste of my time.",2

In comparison with other MOOCs I've participated in which have clearly been designed with online delivery and audience in mind, the format of this MOOC was not engaging. It's also baffling that they would spend nine weeks on public policy in the 21st century and only include one female speaker and not a single person of colour. The 21st century at the University of Virginia must look quite different from the 21st century where I am. There was also a lot institutional promoting of the University of Virginia / Batten School itself which I haven't experienced in other courses. While I did find some of the speakers and subject matter to be of interest, I had hoped for more from this MOOC.",2
105019,"This course is not meant to stand alone as a single course, rather is a portion of a larger Agile Development course. I'm sure the information included is very informative, but it references information that was included in other courses. The first lessons start with diagrams that are not explained and terms that are not defined (which I presume were probably covered in the first course). Also plenty of references to information from other courses (""Previously we learned"" ""Remember the example"").Dropped the course, not that I didn't understand it, but rather it was not worth my time to play ""catch-up"" on my own. Suggest removing this course as a free-standing course, or revising to allow the data/lectures to stand on their own.",2

86215,"Excessively short course. Like previous course in the specialization no slides of the lectures were provided. Approach over-simplistic. IE could done more. Also as in previous course there was no supervision from the staff of the discussion forums. Also looking at the big picture, there is a tremendous gap in quality and approach to online courses between EU institutions and US top tier institutions (favoring the US offerings). Looking at Wharton, U. Michigan, Yale courses (just to mention a few) and then looking at the majority of European offerings, the gap is very salient. If IE wants to stay relevant in this online space, some benchmark is advised... If you are in the 'game', you must 'play' it better...I hope you will accept my critic as constructive and positive, not as negative. As an European I am more critic and I would like to see more quality, relevance and credibility of EU offerings. As it is, it is a matter of time until Wharton and U. Michigan spread their offerings into this specific field and with a superior approach they will most likely divert students to their offerings, probably lowering and marginalizing your courses.But despite my critics it is fair to salute you for your efforts and availability to offer this course.I wish yoy luck.Ricardo J.

After having taking Cloud Computing Concepts Part I and 2 (which were excellent), I expected a continuation of the very deep level of technical material. This course doesn't do this. Instead it is sort of much higher level except that the instructor fails to stay at the high level and will suddenly go deep - but without providing the detail so that someone to whom this is new will be totally lost. Given that I was expecting the technical depth of CCC parts 1 and 2, I already had much of the knowledge that was presented and could figure out what the instructor was trying to present, but I felt bad for someone who wasn't already familiar with the material. It is my opinion that the course needs to be taken offline and redone.Note: Apparently I took a prior version of CCC parts 1 and 2 so my comments on those two courses may or may not apply anymore.",2

People were trying to decipher the wording of the questions, not learning how to code. Lectures of later weeks were ""rushed"", very little buildup of understanding and I felt assignments were done for the sake of passing, very little were learned during those final 3 to 4 weeks. Effort were mostly wasted as little learning has been retained. May be there are topics that needed to be introduced for Course 4, will see, as I'll be doing straight after. The course overall is still very positive and the prof. clearly has put in a lot of effort and they are greatly appreciated.",2

23490,"The very first lesson implies that sufficient quantities of micronutrients can't be obtained from a diet high in animal-based proteins and fats. In reality, organ meats and egg yolks are higher in micronutrients than many fruits and vegetables, and only small amounts of dark-colored veggies and fruits are required to balance a diet that already contains a variety of meats (as far as both species and cut). The body is also better able to synthesize glucose (or utilize ketones instead of glucose to fuel cell function) than to synthesize amino acids, which are more easily obtained in the correct amounts from animal sources. Plant-based diets work for some people, but if blood sugar levels, chronic inflammation and/or amino acid intake are issues that an individual needs to take into careful consideration, a high-fat, low-carb, diet with a variety of animal products is more likely to meet their needs.",2

These assignments are so unrealistically hard that they demotivate. And I'm saying that as someone who already had quite some ideas for one game and even started experimental programming.

In multiple videos, there were typos. In at least one video, the instructors had not fully deleted the sentences from a previous version of a slide. When the revised slide was presented to the viewer, a word from a previous version was in the middle of the sentence. In addition, the previous version was obviously about a different subject.I was disappointed and continually frustrated with this course, especially since the instructors required me to pay fifty dollars in order to take the module quizzes and the final assessment. I have no problem paying for a good product. However, the professionalism displayed in the course was incredibly lacking.",2

The success of an organism depends on its survival in the habitat, etc. but it does not depend on the mutation itself. The mutation confers a fighting advantage, perhaps, but it has no will of its own. There were many times the professor seems to be saying that evolution is somehow willful.

A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics, but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums. If these really are ""core concepts"", as described by the mentors, one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases (which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources). It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners, given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics, tons of time on fairly advanced topics, and almost no time on critical intermediate-level content.",2

The use og graphlab is unnecessary and adds a layer of complication which adds no future value to your toolkit. Probably a lot of better executed Machine Learning courses out there,2
90127,"The contents and quality of the video lectures are great.The quality of the supplementary materials (like the quizzes and the Matlab code) provided by TAs for the assignments are very poor. The assignment guides are written with very poor grammar. The Matlab code is written using the worst coding and documenting practices. The automatic evaluation system (the system for grade the submissions), doest't provide useful feedback. As people can read in the course discussion forums, students have been asking for months for improvements to the grading systems.",2
90331,"The speaker isn't very good, he speaks looking at his monitor all the time while he is reading the slides. I am not very happy about this course, I think it could be better if subjects would be deeper.",2

104792,"Sorry to say, but for me as a non-native english speaker, most videos are hard to follow. Its because speaker talks fast, unclean and with bad sound quality. Of course I'm not used to the mathematical english terms. Also the many animations with the slides made it hard for me.",2
68416,"I have no doubt teachers are excelent professionals in the area, as well as great machine learning enthusiasts. However, I did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and (very!) expensive platform, mostly because there are many other free packages available for machine learning. Ok, the platform offered makes things easier, but if you really want to learn machine learning, you can not be limited to a platform, acting as a robot just using pre-written functions in a black box.",2
85909,very basic,2
90923,The material this course provided is sufficient for a beginner in robotics. But I have to say that the material the coursed presented is not well prepared. The lectures are not well organized. Some necessary prerequisite should be at least provided as reading materials. Quizs ask some questions that is not clearly mentioned in the lecture and some are with a little ambiguity.,2
106615,Dry Material and the second professor was,2
25136,The lectures were very informative and clear. I had no problem giving the quizzes with the lectures. The project I had no clue where to begin. There has to be extra lectures included to guide the project. I hope they add some lectures as whatever lectures are currently available are,2

You hear about it but are not actually taught the right way to make one. At best case you are taking a guess and at worst you are learning bad habits or missing out on what should be in it.",2
88891,"Probably I am biased by just having followed edX's Minds and Machines. Compared to that course, the lectures here are superficial and not very engaging. This becomes especially striking for overlapping topics between the two courses. Also the quizzes are way too easy and you can try until you get it right. This makes the certificate virtually worthless, although you can pay for it.",2

10108,First week of 3 min video. Seriously we want to dive into the subject. And the last two weeks should have more content. Felt like much more copy and paste without understanding why you did that. Understand this should be introduction to Big Data... But the price you pay for the introduction is too expensive.,2
82531,"Professor Dinham's investigative and research based approach is great, and in my opinion much needed in the professional educational community worldwidely. The material is presented thoroughly and the second piece of peer-assesed assignment is pretty well explained.However, I think the course material proposed in the outlines should be more diverse, by adding complementary video lectures, research articles and book extracts in every week, since this was proposed in this way just in fifth week; course 5 of the specialization program is a great example of that.The first piece of peer-assessed assignment may improve by being clearer and giving the opportunity to the learner to express his/her own ideas, instead of request a summary from this. Multiple Choice Questions should follow the principles exposed in the 6th course of the specialization program, which seems to not be done at all. Forums prompts should be shorter and clearer by highlighting a single key question instead of a bunch of these as happened.",2
102160,"Content is good. But you need to pay to be able to answer quiz. In other courses of that specialization track you even need to pay to do peer assessments. It is a shame that education and securing the learn success seems not to be the focus anymore - it seems that focus turned towards monetization.So before taking the course be aware that you can not get a participation rate of 100% due to locked quizzes, which will only be unlocked once you paid.",2

12286,The value of this course is the collection of reading materials that can be found in the same place. The lectures don't add much to the course.,2
51950,"The course content is perfect, however the rating system is kind of disappointing. First, the rating is very subjective, thus I might pay great efforts to my submission but get a grade below my expectation. Second, sometimes I can be busy on weekends thus I want to finish the peer review earlier on Friday, however, there might often be not enough submission to be reviewed, thus I am very pressured to do this with a exhausted mind and body in the evening on Sundays. Could I just pass if there's no other submission to review?",2

50129,"As someone with a very limited background in statistics, I found the course jumped very quickly from basics to extremely complicated statistical modeling with all the jargon that comes with it. So either the course description didn't provide enough information for a non-statistician to realize it will get very complex, or the language and explanations should have been simplified/more descriptive for the audience.",2
12161,"Unnecessary video segment at the start of each lecture is annoying and a total waste of time. The content of the course lacks in substance compared to the ""An Introduction to American Law"" course. So much time spent on European effect on British law: this is not a course for lawyers, I would presume, but supposed to be an introduction.",2
103644,Super boring & clinical presentation of the material.,2
3153,"This course -- actually, both the 2nd and 3rd courses in this specialization -- are like ""take your interested, but mostly uninformed friend to work day"". Give them some stacks of paper to sort, then shown them what a correctly sorted stack looks like. You've only got one day at work with your friend, so be kind enough to humor them with a very cursory explanation of what sorting is about, but you can't really teach them much in such a short time. So, set them to task, sorting pile after pile. Hey look! Your friend is now a practiced sorter!These courses are really for folks who can spend much more time than advertised. Sure, you will see lots of really cool things -- like AngularJS, Grunt, Bower, etc. -- but don't come into this believing that you'll really learn them, because that is just not possible with the time allowed. This whole thing is about exposure, not deep understanding.Want to learn the guitar? This is like going to watch a (very slow) concert, and then having the guitarist hand you their instrument, put your fingers on the correct frets, and then strum the strings for you. See -- now you can play!Thinking of learning algebra? How about if I simply told you to ""write the numeral 5, then the addition symbol, then the letter X, then the equals symbol, and finally the numeral 12"", and then proceeded to tell you, step-by-step, what you should write on the page in order to solve for X. Would you have learned about solving equations? At most, you would have written a workable example for solving a certain kind of equation, but I doubt you'd be anywhere near proficient after being hand-held through one example.On the positive side, I was exposed to many different things in the web-development world -- that I cannot argue against. However, this course could be so much more. The model of having students watch a video of a person talking about coding, whether in front of a Power Point slide or a text editor full of code, is borrowing from the worst of the ""lecture-first"" classroom experience of (most of) higher ed. It's a bummer that we aren't moving in a different direction with this stuff after so long, but I guess it's still what people expect (or at least have learned to cope with).",2
80566,"I have mixed feelings about this course. I notice that a lot of courses like these in US colleges are incredibly glorified. The professor sounds knowledgeable, I have to admit. The material, however, seems mostly like common sense. Most of it is life skills that you simply pick up over time. Just like business courses, people love to label everything concept or process with some kind of nice sounding term to make it look professional or whatever. Also, very boring.",2
11845,Some matters were just given formulas and there was a lack of practice. The course should cover less materials or be longer to be effective in teaching.,2
82882,Content of the course and presentation was great. But the audio quality was not so good. As they are echos on the background and need to set to high volume to heard the speaker.,2
98332,"I found much of the content to be interesting and timely. However, I thought the quizzes were poorly written. There was no feedback, so as a learner it was hard to grow from errors. Also, there were many that required more than one answer, if you missed one, you missed entire question. Without feedback, it was difficult to know which one you missed. The week 4 lesson content was a bit dense for an introductory course. It was dry and could've been more global. Last, the large lesson assignment was only graded by peers with no feedback from the instructor.",2
15194,"It is generally good course, but I feel it is just a combination of very little tools, skills and ideas. I believe it is quite complicate for me to understand, esspecial git and github. I think it is better to combine this course in other courses where you need it.",2
28269,Too simple and boring,2
101213,"I didn't like the professor's teaching style. He took way more time than was necessary to get his points across. Plus the little quips where he's pretending to engage with the viewer made it feel like a kids show. There were some good nuggets of info, but there was too much filler to get to it.",2
4312,"Beware this course, especially if you are new to this area (despite what the course/specialization says). There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course, but what's worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos; the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos, so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignments/projects satisfactorily or smoothly.I am extremely dissatisfied and wish I hadn't paid for this specialization. Beware.",2
103894,"Should be lecture by Professor instead of BS student.The content was not well organized.Also should prepare slides and explain the Swift for more details.More exercises needed in each weeks lecture.Hopefully, this course should improve next time.",2
71781,Too little content for the price.,2
93239,"From my past experience, I know it’s not easy for people to take suggestions. But I still want to have a try this time.I had high hopes for this course, but I am quite disappointed. I think Dr. Peng needs to improve his teaching skills.1. Good teaching is clear, concise, and right to the point. So please slow down, speak. Don’t mumble.2. Programming is a practical skill. So the best method to learn programming is to use step-by-step demos. You can talk about a concept for 5 to 10 minutes but I still can’t get it. Use a demo and I can get it right away.3. Don’t just try to cover the materials so you think you have done the teaching, try to understand how your students learn and make sure they really get it.4. If you haven’t covered some concept, don’t assume your students will understand it by magic.A good teacher can make the learning experience effortless and fun, a poor teacher makes it like a torture.",2
85648,"For a course with the name ""Pro Tool Basics"", I was expecting some specific knowledge about this particular software but what the course really teaches is basic music production things (samples, synthesizers, how to create tracks, how to record audio, compressors, EQs, etc).As I am already a music producer using Logic Pro, I was hoping to learn more about the software itself and its differences in comparison with other DAWs in the market, so I was a little bit disappointed in the end!",2
21994,"Didn't really cover how to deal with messy data, e.g. if you need to join to datasets and have orphans, or you have no foreign keys between two datasets and you need to use fuzzy matching.Basic validation was also not covered (i.e. making sure that your data covers all that you expect).",2

65534,"While the content of the course is interesting and useful, the delivery desperately needs improvement. The professors speak in an extremely monotonous way, making it seem like they are reading their lines from behind the camera. Just awful, and makes it really hard to follow and stay interested and connected with the topic (even when you're passionate about the subject).I would rather have the course in Italian, and read the subtitles, if that means a more energetic delivery.",2
89694,"Vastly concerned with the esoteric minutia, ideas, and meanings assigned by others regarding photographs which most often aren't even closely aligned with the original artist's intentions.A brief few mentions of how photography has changed over time with advances in technology and development of new techniques was mildly interesting, otherwise this course was predominantly meaningless. This course will most likely be of no benefit to people not viewing or creating fine art photography.",2
94498,Coursera keeps changing my rating. Not cool.,2
17281,"This course is quite outdated. I didn't learn much beyond what I already knew before I started. The Spark courses from edX are way better than these. Hopefully ""Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark"" from the ""École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne"" (also from Coursera) is good (I know their Scala courses, which are taught by Martin Odersky, are quite good).There are very few quizzes between lectures and the assignments are not very challenging.Many of the videos, specially the ones at the end were extremely rushed over. They serve more as a review if you know the subject, otherwise I don't think most people will get much from them.The audio isn't very good for most of the lectures, many having an very annoying chirping sound (from when you leave an old flip phone near a computer... ""teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-tehhhhhh...."". Gosh, I haven't heard this sound in maybe over five years...).",2
70151,"While the lectures were good, one of the mentors wasn't profesional at all, she was nasty, though the other one was very fine.But my chief complaint is the terrible method (in creative writing classes only ?) of using peer reviews to pass the class. I had a non-English-speaking person NOT pass me, a former English teacher, for no other reason than he misread the assignment. So I had to resubmit. I don't know who finally passed me, I think the peer review process is a shambles, and it lets Coursera personnel out of the process of doing grading and opens a can of worms with an incompetent peer reviewer having the power to not pass me. I don't think I will be taking creative writing classes again at Coursera, as going through that broken peer review process and having one mentor being off the wall just wasn't worth my time and anxiety.",2
58359,"Level of difficulty of lectures is not correspond with level of quizzes. In lectures they are talking about simple stuff and then in quizzes they ask you about details they didn't mentioned. You could deducts this information though.

It is a good contextual introduction if you never heard of ""search engine marketing"", ""cost per acquisition"" or ""click through rate"". If you know the basics, it is probably not a good use of your time.I didn't like that the content feels like evangelism for (paid) google services, and most sources of the course are either random blogs or related to interested parties (google, twitter). I still learnt a couple of cool metrics I didn't know about, but the course didn't bring any added value to the blog links provided.",2
40473,"Video lectures are really bored, bad presented and almost useless. Most (if not all) of the useful content is presented in sections called web tours which are collections of websites were one can find information about the specific topic of a lesson.

24832,"This class was bizarre. Some of the content and lecturers was fantastic, but some lecturers were quite dull and some lectures and quizzes were poorly written and misleading. The class was also strangely designed and executed: the amount of content per week varied significantly; the vast majority of the content was in a very specific energy sector (biofuels) and other key sectors were almost entirely overlooked; it also seems like the content is already a few years old.

(p.s. the persons who transcribed the videos should have taken the time to see and hear what they were translating since there are quite a few errors on names, locations, even simple words). I also found the lessons rather superficial, did not ""dive"" into the heart of this great civilization. Finally, having read a book or two on the subject, the whole experience added almost nothing to my previous knowledge on ancient Egypt.

The programming assignments, however, have very little connection to the lectures. I have some experience using software with command-based interface (including R) for statistical analysis, and I am relatively good at searching and finding information independently, but this course was way too hard even for me. I might revisit programming assignments again once I have more time and more experience with the application, just for the sake of completing the course, but I kind of find it silly that I need experience with R to pass the course intended for people with little to no experience with R.",2

Also, some of the assignments are designed in a pretty strange way (e.g. one week's assignment requires a shocking 10 peer reviews to pass but when I took the course, there were only a few submissions).

And I have done the ""talking to the camera"" thing and it can be deadly for presenters. It is not BTW an ""age thing""; I am older than he, I am sure, and do not ask that presentations be entertaining - just that they be engaging.

Being a true beginner w/no background in programming or data science, I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises (which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate) and lectures. I spent 8-12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in. I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems.",2
67186,"There is a lot of good information in here that is told poorly. Professor simply reads the slides to you for the most part, foregoing practical examples in favor of sticking to abstract concepts, and letting you figure out the details. Quizzes had errors in them that made passing them unnecessarily difficult. The slides that you could download are sometimes cutoff, leaving information out. This is very indicative of the classes I had in college, where the class was ""here are a bunch of whitepapers/books, read them, and you'll be an expert"". There is little in the way of helping you understand these complicated concepts, and because they are complicated, many argue that should absolve the professor from needing to find a way to teach them in an understandable way (when other professors have been able to take complicated topics like this and distill it down to something that was both fun to learn and gave a solid foundation for going forward). I'm sure Professor Hinton has contributed much to the field, but I suspect his passion lies in playing with ideas and theories, not in trying to teach the next generation about how to do so.",2
38602,Headed downhill. Lessons are starting to feel like not enough time was put into preperation... or like this course was assigned as a project to some students so the professor could make a dollar (like textbooks). One of the instructors even said at one point they didn't have enough time. What does that even mean in an online course. You could be fixing it right now and improving the course. This whole thing is being handled like a college course and that is crazy. On-line courses can undergo continual improvement. The college course paradigm is dying because we can do it better now.

The assistant instructors (likely this guys students) are not as great and the whole thing is amateur night.,2
92020,"The course was informative and some of the material regarding databases will be useful towards my current job. However, I felt that in classes 3 and 4, Python was really an after thought. I believe I could have completed this course without ever taking the first two classes because the assignments only required slight modifications to existing code. I was more analyzing patterns rather then truly understanding the code. I would rather see the course continue to expand upon basic programing knowledge so that I can write the code by myself instead of seeking examples to cut/paste all the time.",2

Even the assignments were a re-hash of the ones from the first course.

I just would have liked to have more instruction or examples of the elements of composition hierarchy.",2
5954,"The course starts very promising, but it gets worse week after week, culminating on a barely understandable week about dynamic programming. That’s when I gave up and decided to write this review instead, with just one assignment missing to complete the course.Some of the teachers aren’t native english speakers, which is fine, but their english is very hard to understand. I found myself having to watch some portions of the videos over and over again in order to understand what was being said. I tried reading the transcripts instead, but the they’re even worse! It seems that they were automatically generated from the videos, thus suffering with the poor pronunciation.The teachers use mathematical sophistication that feels unnecessary, but to be fair, they do mention it on the FAQ as part of the necessary background. However, even though it’s an online course, they barely use any teaching method besides very raw slides, some dry mathematical proofs and someone speaking about the content. The only resources offered to help learning are a few open source visualizations. I expected much more.The only good aspect from this course are the assignment checkers, which allow you to write your solutions in multiple languages.I deeply regret the money and time I spent on this course.",2
88717,"The only thing I had to do in this course regarding the required assignments was to change python 2.7 code to 3.4 as that's what I'm using.Presentations didn't add much towards the learning either. Definite downgrade from previous courses, especially from the first three.",2
94679,"The course has a lot of interesting material, but I believe that a few points may be improved:1) Exercises with Matlab are not programming ones (except for the PD controller). In my opinion, more detailed exercises (with a guide for solving them) would help to understand better the concepts behind the theory. For example, programming a rimless wheel or a SLIP template.2) The course has a strong emphasis in theory. Some of the lectures were boring an difficult to follow. As I said before, a more practical approach would be more rewarding.3) Quizzes were sometimes based on intuition, or topics outside of the course, rather than topics learned from the lessons.On the other side, the TAs were highly involved in the course. In addition, an extensive list of additional resources (books, papers) is a plus.I believe that the following sessions will be better than the first one!",2

Further, the solver addin (needed for the week 6 assignment) is not consistent across different excel versions and libre calc, which resulted in a whole lot of guesswork to pass this assignment. I'm sorry to say the course never came close to my expectations, despite the very interesting topic. Would not recommend.",2

It jumps in with overviews but contain some high level items you won't understand until later in the course and it really doesn't give enough context to be meaningful at the time. It almost seems like it was thrown together without a clear mission of what should be in the introduction. Being a developer who has used some of the tools in this toolbox (Git, GitHub, Command Line) this intro really glosses over tools that most non developers won't understand. If I had a say in what should be in this intro it would be one video end to end of setting up the tools. The second video would be all about the history and logic and some of the applications we will be exploring without all the r formulas in the slides.",2

I know what I need to be doing & I was hoping the course would inspire me to do it. Unfortunately, it did not. I got tired of hearing about walking or bicycling to work as the main way to get active.

There just one part of a module (aprox. 15 min) that got into some detail.Also, there was no interaction at all in the forums. If at least the mentors could set some interesting subjects and comments to motivate that, would be of help.Due to this, my expectations weren´t met. Was looking for detailed service industry (financial) applications of process improvement knowledge.",2
95313,"Content is actually very good, I can feel the content creator and staffs emphasis on real world problems. Projects and Assignments are quite useful, and I can expect to use skills I acquired in my day to day work. However, the most agonizing parts of this course is it requires tremendous of time to do self-study. I spend tons of time on google search, reading docs and go over other people's post on various forums in order to find the right way(sometimes optimal way) to finish the assignments. I understand and accept that self-study is very import to master things nowadays, but I really think gap is too big between what was taught in class and what you need to complete this course, especially for people that has zero data science programming experience like me.I'd rather spend time watching 2 more hours of teaching videos per week that can cover more aspects/topics/tips/tricks than go over lots of docs and posts. I won't deny I learned a lot through this course, but I believe my learning curve can be flatten significantly if there is more class materials available. If the majority of course is spent on googling, what's the point to take it?",2

This is almost like learning how to cook without knowing how to use a knife.",2
97398,"I've just completed the course subject to peer review grading. I must say that this was the WORST online course I've ever taken and I've taken a lot of online courses (including YouTube tutorials by people who were clearly intoxicated when creating their masterpieces).To begin, the recommended software options for screen movies and presentation are awful choices - not to mention ""Prezi"" is subscription service. I didn't use it. Try Open Office which has a ""PowerPoint"" type presentation software if you are looking to save costs. There's also an enormous technical problem with the screen movie makers suggested (at least with the PC versions). You cannot record from your microphone and capture internal sound card information (i.e. sounds produced by your DAW) simultaneously with any of the ""suggested"" programs I tried. The solution was a virtual sound card (I used Voice Meeter) where I could route the sounds accordingly so you could hear the sound produced by my DAW while I spoke. Considering this is a technology course, you would think this would be addressed. It is not.There is almost no practical discussion. There's plenty of ""what,"" --- an overwhelming amount of what actually --- but not much ""how"" or ""why.""Others may experience this course differently depending on your goals. If you record vocals and real instruments and want to learn how to do this so everything sounds fantastic, this isn't the course for you. There's a tiny bit of that discussed with microphone placement and the like, but it quickly moves to digital sound creation. If you want to use synths and effects and noise things and such to create EDM music ... well, this isn't the course for you either, but maybe it would be more beneficial to you than most other categories.So, who is this course for? I can't say I'm sure of the answer to that. If you are wanting to be a sound designer, perhaps you would learn the vocabulary for sound design but not much ""how."" If you use Logix as your DAW, perhaps you will learn where something is you hadn't seen before (although the videos are hard to follow as some things are happening off screen or aren't the focus of the video).In the end, this course was very much a ""self teaching"" course. I didn't learn much from the video lectures provided by Berklee other than application of a few terms in music I'd never considered much with a background in playing instruments rather than playing a digital synth, like ""ADSR."" I spent more time on other websites and YouTube videos and in my DAW's operation manual as we were often told, ""Go to your DAW and figure out how to use an XYZ."" Rarely did it include ""how and why"" to use that XYZ for musicality.The quizzes were awful as well. There's a lot of ""minutia"" detail in the lectures that never seems to have any relevance because there's no practical application discussed. Make sure you know this not very relevant information because it will be on the quiz --- like how to determine the word length and bit depth using some formula involving 2 to the power of something.... it still doesn't make since because I don't know why or how it applies.Also, note that not everything is completely uniform in DAWs with some terms being different in each one. This was extremely confusing because I don't use Logix and the lessons do. I had a terrible time figuring out many things simply because my DAW had another term or button name for it.I'm glad this is over. I feel like I learned a little bit, but don't feel like it's information I'll retain for long since I have no idea how to use much of the information for my purposes. Maybe on a game of Jeopardy?Sorry for the length of this, but I hope you find the information helpful in deciding whether you will benefit from this class.",2

7478,"First, I would like to say that with the exception of ONE exam, I was able to take all the tests WITHOUT WATCHING THE VIDEOS. That shows that this is a poorly put together course. Secondly, this course did NOT cover CHILD NUTRITION, it covered general nutrition. There was nothing helpful in regards to meal planning with children (although there was useful information in the Lunch Packing Video.) Although it claims the project at the end of the course is optional, it will not let me complete the course without doing the project. I find that extremely frustrating. This course offered a lot of great information (even if it was a weird combo of factual/opinionated) I was frustrated by the fact that this course is OBVIOUSLY geared towards the upper middle class/rich instead of the the everyday blue-collar family. I will do the project to complete the course but was very disappointed in my first course through Coursera.",2

The students ultimately figured it out by spending several laborious hours figuring out the peculiarities of the solution checkers, and by helping each other. This certainly soured my experience with the course.",2
4488,"The content is really interesting and useful. However, the way in which the lessons are organised I'd say is confusing. The professor explain you complex concepts like entropy or binary classification to continue with an excel worksheet. It's here where the issue relays, the excel files are filled and instead of learning by doing you have to figure out how the prof made the file. In consequence, the solution is always available.In my opinion, it'd be better if a raw data set is given and you build the model step by step from the scratch.",2

I will say that the research and academic readings made available in the course were exceptionally helpful and full of great information, i just wished that that information was presented in a more engaging and interesting way, sometimes more organized as well. Furthermore, much of the referenced material should be made accessible within the course rather than simply cited; it looks fascinating but from places like China, databases and websites with such relevant sources are often wholly inaccessible.

As a guy who takes and make his own notes, I found it really difficult to put together a sentence he was saying. It seems that nobody proof read his lectures before posting it on coursera.

No adjustment was made to the due date.Requirements for the final project are vague and confusing and I am not able to submit the final project by the due date in about 2 hours.

26967,"Absolutely not apropriate for very beginners. Lacks explanation of ""why"" through all the videos, simply giving you information to remember ""If you do this, this will happen"". Such a structure of explanations doesn't give freedom in the future to do something different, as you don't get a general understanding of what you do.Additionally, all course is tought in Mac. Some commands are different for windows, and they were not even mentioned in the videos! I did not sign up for this course to be forced to spend hours in Google, trying to find how to do something, that supposed to be explained in the lesson.Overall, the course absolutely lacks attention to windows users and is not appropriate for absolute beginners.",2

80996,"Unfortunately, didn`t enjoy this course at all. I have gone through 7 courses on Coursera and finished them with the biggest pleasure and great results. This time I had to leave the course before finishing because:1st: content is organized awfully (for example ""HTML overview"" - I knew all the material so I have an idea how it should look like, but lecturer started from the middle of all concepts, than moved to the beginning and together it looked like an unlinked content. I have simply lost a logic inside this.2nd: Very difficult to get an idea: lecturer doesn`t try to simplify the content, even opposite - I had a feeling, that he makes easy things complicated for a reason. My husbend is a programmer with 10 years experience and when he watched the lecture he said, that even for him it was difficult to understand all the thing (things he actually knows). All these terms used, no relevant examples, too complex words and so on - I lost concentration, I had to google a lot of unknown terms, I had to stop lecture every 30 seconds to reread or repeat the peace of lecture, because I could not understand it. As I mentioned, I know HTML well, but it was described so complex, that it was difficult to link my actual knowledge to lecturer words.3rd: not international student friendly. Use of complex words in places where they were not necessary, complex structures, too fast language... I am pretty good in English, but had to stop video and to google translate some ""smart"" words lecturer used without particular need - I don`t mean definitions, just some epithets to make his speech ""smarter"". I completed Coursera specialization by Michigan University and it was completely easy with plain text, short sentences, so well made for international student.4th: this is boring. I am sorry, but this is true. I am interested in all these questions, but for some reasons I lose my attention every time. Maybe the reason is in all points I have just mentioned, but I didn`t enjoy this course at all and it was the first time I didn`t enjoy something connected with web app development. Please, don`t be mad at me - lecturer is a very charming and charismatic person, but I simply don`t like how the material is presented.5th: I have a feeling like all slides are taken from some scientific books and lecturer reads comments from some science articles, it is not like described with own words, simplified for better comprehension, cleared with own real-life examples and in atmosphere of friendly conversation with some emotions and humor.Please, take my feedback just as my personal opinion and hope other students will enjoy it more.",2

100572,"Good: The video lectures cover a nice variety of topics giving you a good introduction of journalism, ethics, and other important considerations for becoming a journalist.Bad: The entire course feels hastily put together. Some of the videos have summarizing points, which is helpful when taking notes, but they flash on the screen briefly, then cut to a closeup of the lecturer, then cut back to the summery points so quickly that you can't copy them down and it becomes super distracting.The quizzes are a joke. They usually consist of 1-3 questions with two answers each and once choice so outrageous that they don't take any thought at all to complete. You could just skip to the quizzes without watching a single lecture and ""ace"" them easily.The assignments are also a joke. They ask for 1-2 sentence answers max! Some of them ask you to ""use more than one word"" to respond. I've taken free courses on here than involve 1000 word essays and then at least you're forced to process the information in the lectures. You can pass this course without watching a single lecture and that's a travesty to Michigan State.It is full of typos and oversights that could have been avoided if they had once person run through the course as a quality control. One of the quizzes has the answer included right beneath the question as a typo! The simple assignments are described in 3 different places, sometimes with conflicting instructions. They tell you what to do and how to review your peers in one section and then the actually assignment has different instructions on what to do than the page prior so you end up unsure of what the assignment actually wants you to do. For example: the final assignment at firsts asks you how to engage with your audience, and then you click next and the SAME question is now asking you how you distribute content. Did they even try??In Summery: The content in the lectures are a good but shallow overview of journalism, but don't expect to be challenged to do anything but fill in ovals and regurgitate questions.Not too much to learn here.",2

15376,"The content is OK, but that's about it. Near zero interaction from staff, short videos leave a lot to be desired, and worst of all, there seems to be a problem getting everyone's assignments peer reviewed (which makes no sense).There is a somewhat comical thread wherein staff direct students to contact coursera directly via a ""contact us"" link on a page, but get this, the link isn't there. Students repeatedly pointed this out only to get directed again to the non-existant link. In an online forum it's important to actually address concerns. Replys that avoid directly addressing concerns sound like automated messages. And that's the feeling I get here.This course requires a DIY attitude and a willingness to proceed without feedback.If you're looking for a good example of online learning, look elsewhere.",2
15681,"I didn't find this module very helpful and some of the assignments were truly confusing. I wish there was more ""meat"" in the sessions and more availability to access the lecturers more readily when there was confusion.

No matter how many web pages I tried to analyse and with how many different free tools I seemed to come up with the same 2 issues.....if the page was performing badly (which was the type of page we were recommended to choose) there was not enough traffic to it to gather any information/demographics. However even when I chose a popular page I was unable to obtain the requested information because it was not my website so I was not entitled to view this information - again returning zero results.

94444,This course failed greatly to balance the workload by week.

Another proof of week 3 issue: the related swirl exercises start in week2 (2 of them) and finish in week4 (2 more exercises) !!!!!I think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learner/student to do more search/exercises on the subject.,2

No syllubus or suggested reading material was available until the course started, which leaves little time to decide on the value of the course or to acquire the reading materials. The lectures glossed over topics that where only minimally supported by brief supplementary lectures provided by the teaching assistants. At the start of the course the lectures and sparse supporting material were only available in video format; not very conducive for detailed review. The student population had to beg for electronic copies of the materials, which became available around the end of the second week of the four week session. The assignments say they require 3 hours, but I would venture to say that most students have spent way more than 3 hours on the assignments just in researching solutions let alone debugging supplied software along with their portion of the assignment. In summary, the topics were interesting however the organization and supporting materials were lacking making for an unsatisfying learning experience.",2

Granted it cannot be interactive since it’s not a live classroom, but it can be made to somewhat sound like an interactive session...Some slides are too verbal. It would be better to have multiple small demos in a module for different slides/topics instead of just monotonically reading out the slides and then having one demo at the end.Too many lab issues. No one responded or addressed them. In a class with such a short span (1 week), it’s very important that everything works and any questions/concerns are immediately addressed/resolved.Please consider making the lab instructions available for download (say, as PDF files). This will be helpful for any later reference.",2
67032,"This course is a mess. Do not even dare to take it without first doing Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (excellent starter) and before reading ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville. The presentations are awfully boring, there is little interaction of the material (unlike Ng who is deriving the math on screen). Hinton is basically just reading off the crowded slides. Very poor didactic style. I would even go so far as to say that the approach is unscientific: no definitions, derivations, examples. Terms just pop out of the blue.If you already know the topic well, you might gain additional insight from a pundit. Quizes are nice puzzles that need some thinking and math knowledge. Programming tasks are not even in the same ballpark as Ng's. Overall very bad use of the medium available.Invest your time in reading ""Deep Learning"", its challenging but at least its got a very logical structure and style. Also consider Hugo Larochelle's videos.",2
5755,"The videos and explanations are very poor. Most of the time the instructors are reading off a script, and everything feels fake.

66811,"This ""planning"" course was slightly better than the preceding ""landscape"" course, but it was still underwhelming. The instructor seemed better prepared with her presentation, but her dependence on the textbook and speaking style still made it seem as if she lacked mastery of the subject. The course did touch on the important subject matters at hand, but since the textbook was so old (practically outdated by digital media standards), it missed or made little mention of so many innovations and best practices that are now the rule for digital marketers. For example, the increasingly crucial role of marketing automation platforms like HubSpot, Dynamics Marketing and Marketo and how CRMs like SalesForce and Dynamics are driving both marketing and sales strategy. Another example is how email marketing has moved to rules-based and triggered workflows. Again, there's a definite need for this course. I would actually recommend breaking out social, SEO and online advertising into their own courses, rather than squeezed into small segments. Finally, the ""putting it all together"" section is vital for anyone who wants to work in digital marketing, but the coverage here was much too general.",2
93410,There is not much of a relation between what the course gives (explains with the videos and with the SWIRL exercises) and the real exercices they ask to. Too difficult to follow by people new in the programming area.,2

96694,"This is the second course in the Full Stack series by Hong Kong University. Because I find the first course in this series very interesting (the assignments are challenging and easy to understand; the professor does a very good job in explaining the materials), I continue to take the second course, which is this one, a shoot. However, it is a complete disappointment.In every single assignment, it requires a file, which is built by going through every single lectures of the course. That means I have to go through every videos and copy his code to my code in order to get the file. If you have a lot of time, that is perfectly fine. However, if you are a college student like me, you properly will not be able to commit that much time. Personally, when I take a course, I take a look at the assignment and then see what knowledge I need to have in order to complete the assignment. Because of this, I may watch the lecture or just Google out the answer. Requiring a file in order to complete an assignment strips away my liberty in doing so. Furthermore, if you miss a step in the video, your file may very well be ruined and you need to rewatch the video again to see what you missed.Also, the course is extremely slow paced. I have to play back rate to x1.5 normal speed. Sadly, even with faster speed, the lectures are also poorly structured. There are many other materials online that can cover the same amount of information in less time and easier to understand. Combined with the required file for each assignment, this course can easily be a torture.",2

The lectures were short to start with, but adding more examples and passages would have helped.2) Xylophone is perhaps the worst instrument to use to teach this course, especially with the camera facing the front of the xylophone. It was very hard to see what notes were being hit by the mallets (especially when using chords) and therefore it was very difficult to understand (visually) what Gary was doing. I suggest using a keyboard and having the camera shooting from the above of the keyboard (look at how several people have done this on YouTube). This way you can see what notes are being hit, held, and you can see them from a pianist's view.The material was good, but because of the two areas above the teaching was not as effective.",2

A large part of the content each week was simply reading a presentation which you could get from a book. I would expect an online course to be more interactive, have more videos, and more varied content. I found the case studies (where you had to imagine a real life situation and select a decision) useful - there was one of these per week when I think there could have been more, perhaps three a week. The course would also have been improved by the use of peer assessment on the assignments. This would have made them feel more worthwhile and that someone else was actually reading them.",2

39859,I did not like this course. It is a course for those who are already involved into the topic not newbies. Very general short and sloppy explanations and a lot of practical assignments for peer evaluation. I had a lot of experience in classical music but I was puzzled with what goes on in this course. After having completed some other jazz courses I realized that i had no chances to learn anything here since the theory is not explained sufficiently. The title of the course is misleading. It rather should be called a master class on jazz improvisation.,2

The only video that engaged me was the very last one set in the artifact lab. I also feel that if you are going to offer transcriptions of the lectures, someone should proofread them. Not to do so is shoddy work and doesn't do Coursera or Penn any favors.",2
38559,"The content is good, but the pace is too slow. Additionally the way the content is presented is very flat. I'd prefer a bit more passion and enthusiasm. All in all a decent course, but nothing that couldn't have been learnt just by browsing and playing around with GCP trial.",2

83070,"The content seems to be excellent regarding ""what"" is presented. But sadly the sound quality is rather bad: Sounds like an age-old valve radio with A LOT of dropouts. And Professor Daphne is an agile and therefore less disciplined speaker which lessens the understandability of her speech in conjunction with the poor sound quality furthermore. Especially for me as a non-native foreign english speaker it is very hard to follow. And now I am at one point in the course, that is ""Flow of Probalistic Influence"", where she explains a concept without explaining what is meant with the used underlying notions ""flow"" and ""influence"" which makes me difficult to understand what is going on. That means in my point of view that the slides are not sufficiently prepared. Although I'm very interested in the topic I am asking myself after the first view videos if I should continue or drop because my cognitive capacitity is for me to worthful to use it for the decoding of badly prepared and presented material. Ok, my decision heuristic in such cases is ""Use the hammer not the tweezers!"". Therefore I have dropped. Please improve the state of this class from beta to release. Then I will come back.",2

32667,"I was most excited about taking this class (in fact, it's how I found the specialization as a whole) and I did not get as much out of it as I was hoping for. :-\ I think that it's geared to too wide of an audience, so we didn't get as specific as I was anticipating. I also felt that a lot of the time of the videos were taken up by telling us what not to do. (""You don't want to be too far to this side, but you don't want to be too far to the other side, right?"") I did get some good information out of this class, but I found a disconnect between the lectures and the homework. When we were assigned an elevator pitch as an assignment, it might have been nice to have seen some examples of elevator pitches--what makes a good (or a bad) elevator pitch? What kind of things would be a good idea to include? Concrete examples would have been super helpful. Submitting my homework and then seeing that other people did vastly different stuff made me question my own submission (Did we just take it in a different direction or did I (or they) misunderstand the assignment?) but since we're all peer reviewing, it's a case of the blind leading the blind there. This also happened with the SWOT Document...which I don't think was even mentioned in the lectures at all in-depth. Again, it would have been helpful to have seen some concrete examples, as I've never heard of that document before.",2

17834,Very general course. Doesn't give much insight into data science.,2
5096,"Not very helpful. In the homework I spent more time wrestling with commands in R than actually gaining an understanding of the subject matter.Also, I really didn't need so many subject matter examples about the professor's baby's pooping habits. (And my family is Dutch with all the offensive humor that comes with it, so it's not just a matter of the sense of humor not translating)I'm re-taking Statistics with Calculus online at my local state university and frankly, I can't notice any benefit from taking this course first. My current online Statistics with Calculus course is rewarding and I feel like I'm truly gaining mastery of the topics, whereas in the Basic Statistics course I was floundering.The graphics in the way the lessons are presented are well done! But I would have been just fine with fewer graphics if it meant more worked-through examples.",2
95232,"The course lectures were subpar and didn't cover the material in the assignments. Googling for answers and checking stackoverflow for code is a great way to get tips, but it doesn't teach you the core material. I would have rather had links to supplemental readings that the materials were based on. I would not recommend this course as an introduction course unless you've had significant experience with Python data structures and know how to work with lists, dataframes, and iterate over those.",2
103922,The course should have been more thorough and should have been accompanies with good programming exercises as well..At some starting course there was also some cross talk among the instructors. The module on image processing should be reviewed as after some point it becomes sort of boring.,2
19305,"I enjoyed the videos, but not the assignments. I wanted to have fun and learn more about the music that I think makes life more beautiful. The final assignment in the module was unclear to me and the feedback unkind. Telling me to wait a year, get outside help and try again is not in any manner fun or helpful. I can't imagine doing that to a student of mine, a peer, or even a stranger. Nor do I find it in keeping with the claim this should be fun. In the end I would rather be an uninformed lover of music than make myself crazy trying to learn it with people that are taking an introduction class and clearly forgot what it was like to be in your first couple of months of learning music. It is like learning calculus from the math instructor that thinks some of the steps are so obvious that he can skip them forgetting he has a PhD in math.",2
3216,There are no advanced stuff these what is taught are basics any graduate or undergraduate student can easily pickup on his/ her own interest. What a waste of time .,2
88070,One of the worst courses I have taken on Coursera. I have been in IT for 20 years and expected a lot more in this course. There were a couple times that the instructor was inaccurate about a some of the concepts he was teaching.,2
25101,"The course material did not cover anything that we needed to complete the final exam. Although I learned a lot working on the final exam, I felt overly stressed & I had to self teach myself in order to get through it.",2
21240,"Alas, after only 10 minutes of the first video, I am reminded that this instructor does not gear his lectures to the true Beginners among us. He speaks much more for an audience of grad students. I do want to complete this Specialization, so I will try again perhaps after learning more - about statistics and R and who knows what else. I fought my way through the first three courses, but now I'm going to work smarter by finding other ways to acquire this knowledge. Then return to him; maybe. This course should be labelled Intermediate and Statistics should be listed as a prerequisite. (I think; since I don't know what it is that I don't know, I am making a guess as to the missing piece of the puzzle.)",2
63663,"I do like the course, but Coursera has disabled discussion forums for this course, which makes it impossible for the students to interact and find answers to problems or discuss possible errors in the example code. Student interaction is one of the strongest aspect of MOOCs. Without it, this might as well be nothing more than a series of YouTube videos.Had Coursera not discontinued the discussion forums, I'd have given this course four or five stars.",2
79296,"In my point of view the course overall is a bit superficial (even though the decision-making part was very interesting indeed). More importantly, the course lacks one of the richest tools in MOOCS: peer interactions - people voicing their opinions and sharing experiences.Besides that: some of the questions in the quiz looked very ambiguous and there are some editing mistakes in the videos.",2
73836,"It is very well designed for total beginner of programming. But if you learned any language already, it is too too too easy.",2
104843,"This course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good. The instructor seems to take a midway between rigorous mathematics, using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible. RD Peng's courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum (simple language). Having a background in theoretical physics and computer science, this duality in this course is very confusing for me. Also, I do not need to see a tiny, grainy video inset of the instructor during the lecture videos.",2
38260,Cyber security is hardly covered in course. IoT as well is supporting product marketing. Coursera s losing it's quality..,2
82498,"I am kind of disappointed that you have to pay for the course before you can submit the solution to the problem set. However, that is not the main issue of this course, as I fully understand that the financial profit for the lecturer is very important. The main issue of this course is that the chaos in the symbol used in the second programming assignment, the lecturer cannot even main self-consistency in the symbol used. The statement of everything in both PA1 and PA2 is also very confusing.",2
48747,it was too basic information/material for what I was expecting,2
95765,"Assignments at times a bit hazy and there is very little guidance. In general the types of assignments do not lend themselves too well to peer review. This is far off the standard set by courses 1 and 2. Lectures seem a bit generic and although Liz Gerber tries to make it hands on, the subject matter really doesnt seem anywhere as tangible as when Klemmer presents it.",2
5081,"I've only gotten started, but there seems some assumptions made about how much we know and how quickly we can pick up these new terms and ideas.",2
18012,"Mr. Campbell's presentations are quite boring and consist of a handful of phrases repeated over and over again. The subjects are treated very superficially and the presentation style is confusing. I recommend to other students to read the Wikipedia articles about the subjects instead. Several times it feels like Mr. Campbell has never before seen the slides he is reading from and he is simply inventing stuff. Some information presented is plain wrong. Also, there is repeated talk of practical exercises to come, but that never happens. To Mr. Campbell's presentations, I would only award ONE STAR.On the other hand I really liked the presentations from Mr. Farivar. He obviously knows what he is talking about and presents the material in a clear and understandable way. He should take over the whole course and let Mr. Campbell do some research back in his office. I would award 4.5 STARS to Mr. Farivar.The homeworks of this course are simply checking for a very basic understanding of the topics. E.g. ""To do this and that, would you use technology A, B, or C?"" Where the answer are some quite different technologies.The course needs more involvement of the students by going more in-depth and adding some practical exercises.Had the cloud computing specialization started with this course, I would probably have aborted it.",2
94415,To fast pace and missing lot of content to make this lesson enjoyable!!!,2
2451,Very informative but very dry presentations.,2

7257,Basically just a product demo and the lecturer was very hard to comprehend.,2
89862,Very boring,2
21917,"The class is getting stale. The instructors didn't respond to questions on the discussion forums about quiz items, the majority of assessment items seem to be available on Google and 50% of the peer reviewed assessment I checked used plagiarized solutions.",2
90839,This course definitely requires prerequisite knowledge of calculus and matrix math. There is also very little in the way of practical application. The MatLab work is interesting but barely explained. The assignments were nearly impossible without help from other students. Understanding which equations that were shown in the lecture (not necessarily explained) were useful in completing the assignments was not apparent and there was no help from the TAs.I don't think the assignments were irrelevant but without having a background in academic engineering the course needs to walk through similar exercises with explanations to increase understanding and ability to complete the course.While I don't think this course was well presented and I can't say I truly learned anything I am glad I was exposed to the material and I will continue with the Specialization.,2
5829,Bad teaching quality.,2
98535,"The instructor's presentations are so irritating due to him acting in a jumpy, nervous, and hyper-excited manner that I could not stand watching the lectures. If you don't mind that, it's probably not a bad course.",2

6640,"The guided meditations were wonderful, but the introductory lectures for Weeks 1-5 were redundant and boring. These lectures could have been much shorter and would have been equally valuable. Dr. Clifford Saron's lectures were interesting.",2
105212,"I found that the portion of the class that taught story-telling was painfully over simplified. I learned nothing and felt no challenge whatsoever, in fact, I felt as though I was rehashing information from a 9th grade English class (no hyperbole). The other component of this class was learning how to create documents that you could use to pitch your game to developers. I found this component to be useful, but it could have easily been compressed into a single week if not a single lecture. There is no real accountability when it comes to grading work, as work is peer graded and students grade capriciously without regard for the criteria laid out in the lecture. In other words, most students responded to how cool or interesting they found my assignments, without regard for the weekly lecture or the grading criteria. It often felt as though the lectures didn't matter at all. Right when the class begins to introduce a more robust tour of laying out a game story, it suddenly ends. This class is only useful to students who are interested in an area of game design besides writing and who are taking the whole series anyway. If you are seriously interested in writing, this class will have little value for you and I would recommend skipping it.",2
11837,"If you already know everything about the topic and just forgot some little things or you are very strong in calculus, this may be a nice refresher. Otherwise, not very useful. Really dense and little explanation. I liked the Youtube MIT course on Probability (it includes Bayesian Statistics) much more, since it has good explanation of the concepts.",2
79157,this course needs much more evidences and examples to support the valuable information.,2
10030,Too much time required. The first Quiz had almost nothing covered in the video lectures. I saved all transcripts and was unable to answer the questions. The Sim's... I have never seen anything like that and again - it most certainly wasn't covered in the lectures. Disappointed in this course. It took 3 hours for each segment of the first week... not 3 to 4 as was stated. Leaving this course.,2

23290,Very basic knowledge,2
39505,Introduction is fine. But was less interactive. Found instructor reading slides only throughout the lecture which was boring and less interesting. Like other Coursera course i found it boring whatever text on slide i learnt but nothing interactive and practical. Just a slide reading. Very much theoretical. Disappointed,2
90180,"The assignments were hard, not because of the contents of the courser, but for understanding the context of the method being implemented (what each variable meant and how it was expressed).Also, there should be a range of submissions that could be right but having higher or lower scores depending of how long it took to find the path, or how long the path was to reach the goal.",2
24406,"I find far too theoretical, too dry; no examples, no exercise guidelines. It's almost having someone reading the slides to you. Still useful for someone like me that never done financial engineering, to find all the concepts in one place. Hence the two stars as oppose to one.",2

In my opinion, the forums are one of the great features in the Coursera which could really helps student to learn the content better.Sincerely,Omid",2

36867,Good content,2
64798,"Too much math! This course was not at all what I was expecting it to be... which could be both good and bad, depending on your own perspective. It concentrates heavily on the logistical side of negotiations via mathematical analysis to figure out ""what's at stake"" in a negotiation (i.e. ""the pie"") and less so on learning actual negotiation techniques. I got halfway through the first week before deciding to un-enroll. That said, Professor Nalebuff has a very engaging teaching style and presents each lecture in a dynamic fashion via animation. If you are a math whiz who excels in algebra and can do complex mathematical equations quickly on the fly, then this course will definitely benefit you. If you are like me, however, and looking for a course that will focus more on artistry and practical real-world application, then this course is not for you.",2
5007,"The class isn't over but I'm suffering through it, not enjoying it, like I did the dino Uof A classes. Problems: the presenter is HORRIBLE. He's sing-songy, trying to be interesting. Can't you get the dino guy? Or me -I'll do it for free. PAINFUL. Also - you need more graphics. Charging along with Mr. Boring and a map of Alaska behind him as concept after concept - difficult ones for folks who aren't like me with lots of background - is a perfect recipe for lack of comprehension. Even inept and cheesy graphics would be better than nothing. Yes, I noticed that the earth is spinning the wrong way in the ""sun at an angle around the sun"" graphic but who cares? It's something. And yes, I know it's free, and I know you have budgets, but 3 universities can't rustle up a graphics undergrad to help out and call it an internship?? The content is probably better than my perception - and I'm perceiving high! - because I need an aspirin after 20 minutes of Mr. Please Get A Professional Presenter [or at least competent.] I create online education that is nothing better than Powerpoint and a talking head, lack of budget, but at least the head doesn't make people want to drown themselves in a melting glacier.",2
11816,"I get lost a bit too often.The teacher sometimes explains easy concepts and omits the difficult ones (e.g. exponential distribution is explained as ""for example if you are waiting for a bus that comes every ten minutes"" and then he tells you how to compute expected value and moves on, but he does not say WHAT IT MEANS - is it the probability that I will meet an oncoming bus? is it probability of waiting ten minutes for the bus? is it the average waiting time? is it average number of buses that come every hour? - but there is detailed explanation of what A squared means in lesson two (!))The teacher often makes me confused as to where he got the numbers he is plugging in the formula or what answer the formula gives.But I take it as a challenge and I intend to finish the course despite all of that. Sometimes it is fun to decipher the mystic equations. And maybe it is me, maybe I was not born to be a statistician. Maybe there are people that find this stuff easy and understand it right away.I really like the quizes. They are HARD.One last thing: Wearing white shirt and using white marker makes it impossible to read what he writes. But I take it is part of the challenge ;-)",2
78804,"Initially, I was excited about this course, but I lost interest due to two things. First, while the beginning segments about how we know the Presocratics was great, the presentation of the early Milesians was shallow and did not deepen my understanding of their world and thought. Then, the section on Parmenides made me lose faith in the teacher - she presented his main ideas in such a way as to obscure his vision, which is of what we now call a multiverse, a world in which all things exist potentially. The best part of the course was that it made me seek out other writers about Parmenides.",2

Suggest divide Week 6 into two sessions: Neural Network and Nearest Neighbor applying neural network results (ImageNet 2012 was mentioned and not explained. Therefore the Nearest Neighbor homework assignment from the student's perspective does not have much to do with neural network other than using the results from ImageNet 2012, which was not explained in any detail anyway). This will allow more time to delve into the forward and backward propagation which should have been explained in more details.(4) Home assignments are not best worded, especially homework assignment for Week 6. Suggest reword in shorter statements that are more to the point.(5) Programming presentation and assignments can seem like exercise in graphlab and SFrame functions rather than machine learning.PRO:(1) Class presentation by Professor Fox on recommender system is detailed and clear.(2) Classifier block diagram shown by Professor Guestrin is good, clearly distinguishing training the classifier and the subsequent use of the classification (prediction).(3) Neural network quiz in Week 6 is excellent.

Courses like these highlight all the problems (and there are a fuck ton of problems) but contain fewer answers. So it just leaves the ""graduate"" overwhelmed and kind of spinning in a circle.

More importantly, only a very limited subset of the course is covered with the suitable and valuable video lectures.Especially the last of the three-week course consist mostly of reading material from an external website.The exercises after each of the three weeks are at the lower end of what I have seen on Coursera and the lecturers should consider putting more effort in creating useful questions for formative and summative evaluations of the learning progress.In summary, smart lecturers present a very interesting and highly relevant topic, but they put to little effort in creating a compellingly online course.",2

This is quite devastating for me. I can read the slides myself (although I have to download it first, since the fonts on the screen are very small). What I need is the professor to explain the logic behind the formulas, the *why* behind what is written, instead of just reading *what* is written on the slides.I find it amusing that with an expected learning of 8 hours a week, the total duration of the first week's videos add up to a mere 36 minutes. A couple of weeks ago I have just finished a course that subjectively is comparable in its difficulty level. That course is also rich in mathematical content and also requires a commitment of 4-8 hours per week. Each week, the duration of the lecture videos amount to somewhere between 120-150 minutes - and the lecturer didn't read slides; instead, he would explain the logic behind the concepts and provided papers for learners to read on our own time. That approach really helped scaffold my learning.I hope you'd consider revisiting this course's learning plan - or probably just state on the course info page that this course is more suitable for a refresher course rather than an introductory one.",2

If perhaps many types of structures had been emphasized or structures had been pointed out as optional, this would have been mitigated, but the time period is so short that there's no time.

I think the course is FAR too expensive for the content provided. All of the other reviews I have seen for this course are a single line such as 'I liked the course a lot' or something equally vacuous and unhelpful. If you are a beginner I would suggest trying 'Python for the absolute beginner' by Michael Dawson. If you have ANY programming experience, you might be better with a more advanced course.",2

Also, one of the required videos proved helpful, and a couple of the optional Ted talks were ""must see's"" for anyone involved in the non-profit sector.It was problematic that there was so little direction with respect to how one might access the required reading materials that were not linked into the course syllabus. In fact, one of the links provided simply directed the learners to a youtube video, extolling the virtues of the book wherein the required chapter was located. Another blatant colleague marketing technique occurred during the course of one of the required videos wherein the organizer interviewed an author about his book. (There was some helpful substantive information that came out of that interview, but for the most part, I felt as though I was watching an infomercial.) Requests for help fell on deaf ears, except for those of co-learners.A small, but annoying, flaw was that the professors were simply reading text from their slides, for the video component of the course--with an additional word thrown in, on occasion, for good measure.

I was lost for a while. When I managed to correct where he'd left me in the dark, I found that my class assignments failed to override the bootstrap defaults. I didn't get much help when I asked if he had altered the bs files or changed his specificity in order to get them to work. Overall - I'd give the class a C+.

When introduced to a new data set, what are some approaches to understanding that data? How do you develop a plan to build a tidy data set (i.e. how do you think about developing a plan, not looking for a step by step instruction set)?It's disappointing that the only way for someone new to data science, R, etc. to tackle the problem is to read someone's third party monologue about how to make your reviewers happy.",2

All the actual algorithms were supplied in a separate module. More than that, many of the suggested solutions were bad coding (like collapsing 50% of the data before training, or writing sixteen special cases rather than a general function) or pointless (like training a linear classifier on pixel data).There are better courses out there.",2

51164,"While this course seems to have potential, there are many aspects of it that don't result in a great learning experience. The course resources comprise of videos and notes. The videos are informative but the notes are fairly lacking. Perhaps the biggest issue that I found with this course was the disconnect between the material covered in the videos and that which was tested on the quizzes. Often times the quiz questions were either painfully easy or worded in such a way that was not verifiable in any of the class resources. As a result, confusion occurred sometimes more often than true learning. A topic such as missing data is naturally very complex and I wouldn't expect a short course on Coursera to be able to adequately cover it. However, I do think that a lot more could be done to improve the value of this course even if that means changing the scope of the materials. Also, the lack of responsiveness to issues raised on the forum and issue-reporting buttons was a disappointment.",2
12846,"I had some issues with this course which is why I rated it a 2.First off, let me start by saying this is a very good overview of what the Cybersecurity Terms are, but I wish it went deeper into the subject.1. Having to pay just to take the quizzes for an overview course is kind of a joke. I could see asking for money if you went into more detail information regarding each lesson, but just telling me what each term means and then pointing me to a website, then asking for 50 bucks is kind of cheap considering no in-depth information was ever given.2. Why did you have all of those people that are in the field of cybersecurity just read off a list of terms? You could have done that, kind of a waste of time for those other people. I am guessing that you had to pay them. Which would explain why you are asking 50 dollars just to take the quizzes.3. Where was the real life experience? Explain to me the most common mistakes people make with each of the different type of networks as securities. That would at least be worth 50 dollars, for some real world practical use. I could have easily googled these terms and have in the past. I thought it would contain more detailed information about the subject considering is technically an online course.",2

There are many, many 1 and 2 minute videos, these could've easily been combined. The teacher seems unprepared in his lectures, he stutters and repeats a lot and makes a weird noise between slides. This shouldn't be necessary with pre-recorded lectures. The assignments and quizzes are also poorly written and contain spelling and sloppy mistakes, which doesn't make sense because the material isn't new. It all just makes it seem like the teacher doesn't really care and just wants to sell the course to a lot of people without putting in much effort.If you are not following the specialization I would not advise this course for beginners.

I consider is a unique innovation in MOOC courses. The professor give excellent information interspersed with interesting case studies. Unfortunately, there was no interaction in my iteration of the course, or any apparent involvement whatsoever, from any TA's or mentors. All questions remained unanswered (except by other students), and frustrated calls for help and advice were ignored. The majority of the course's mark (60%) is determined by fellow students using a rubric which leaves little true 'wiggle room' between pass and fail marks. The mystery cases on which we worked during the course were never 'resolved' or explained in any way, which would have been nice after the effort that went into them. I would recommend the content of the course 'for fun' but if anyone is looking for an accurate assessment of material learned, try another course.",2
63686,"I did not feel that I learned as much in this course as in the previous courses of the series. The assignments in particular seemed trivial, and were compromised even further due to some technical problems with the simulator recommended for students without access to actual hardware.This course would be a good candidate for revision, with a focus on gradually increasing the depth and complexity from stage to stage, and on commonly-used components such as current amplifiers and shift registers. Problems with the simulator should not be cause for compromising the assignments themselves, there are other ways to address those problems, many of which were employed by students as they competed their assignments.",2

32335,"While the subject matter was extremely relevant, I didn't think this course was taught well. Much of the lecture and exercise focused on providing direction than actually teaching. I felt as though I was just copying and pasting sample code. At times it was as though the professor was rushing to introduce new modules rather than discussing how and why certain concepts should be used. In most cases, I could have learned the Ionic modules just as well by reading the documentation and looking at sample code, which is often what this course felt like. I'd have much rather seen the concepts explained in more detail than rushing to add new modules without any context.The quizzes are not challenging (the professor always puts the correct answer as the first choice) and the exercises just provide cut/paste code snippets without any reasoning or explanation. I would have preferred to have the exercises conducted by providing a high level goal and then a solution to check against rather than the ""put this code here"" approach that's used. The assignment grading is either far too obvious (whether a required module was injected or not) or completely arbitrary. Generally the assignments lacked nuance and complexity as well. I didn't feel like I really learned any of the concepts behind this material after going through the course.",2

I am facing the exact same problem with this course as I faced with earlier course.The grading process is badly constructed for final assignment. In fact, now I am learning from coursera staff that may be there are not enough students to grade my peer review assignment.So please do audit this course but do not be trapped in specialization.Cheers..",2

So what I do at the moment: I watch the video and than go to Yuotube to find other videos that deal with the topics in an easier and didactic better way.Examples of good cousres in my opinion are stats and probabilty course/ and the python coursePS ""all of the data toolbox"" course seem to have the same flaws.Of course my knowledge level is low concerning programming ( I am a MD, so hardly scientific educated...).

I feel this would have made more sense after an introduction to the material.I also did not like that the free version of the course did not allow you to complete any of the assignments, as this has not been the case in my other Coursera courses. Not only were you unable to assess your comprehension of the material because of this, but also it meant receiving annoying emails and notifications that I had not completed the module. In other classes I have taken, there are additional resources and content for the paid users.

94506,"This course is the first one in the Data Science series to lapse in terms of the clarity of the lectures, and the sense of cohesiveness of the material. Brian Caffo's lectures in Statistical Inference were good; in this course they seem to veer left and right rather than get straight to the essence of whatever subject he is lecturing about.A more structured final project would have been helpful. The instructions on this project weren't quite so blunt as to say ""Take this data set, do some regression-y stuff and come back with something about these two variables,"" but that's basically as far as our instructions went. It could have been a great learning experience to have a more detailed guide through the construction of a regression analysis, but instead an assignment which was 40% of our grade was put together as an afterthought. It was the assignment equivalent of stopping in the 7-11 a block away from a birthday party to buy a card.Also, in terms of delivering the content: Mr. Caffo needs to structure his slide/video arrangements so that he is not standing in front of the text.

101593,"This isn't a CLASS it's a workshop.Thank goodness for fee waivers; I would have been so upset if I had spent my money on this course. As someone who has taken Coursera offerings in the past, I cannot cosign the quality of this course.This class seems to suffer from both a lack of structure and time. I believe if the course was longer (allowing for more space between unguided assignments) the class would be a little better. I understand that the Instructor is barred by time constraints (this is only a five week course, and an opt-in one at that), so I do relate to not wanting to inundate the class with reading assignment and lengthy lectures.That said, the guidance and lessons are lacking-- even if the class was longer, I would still only give it 2.5/5 stars.It appeared that the onus was on the Mentors to provide answers; for example, the professor mentioned that our scripts are meant to feature half hour pilots. This left many students writing dramas rather than comedies at a loss, since they were planning for hour long pilots. (This, again, is partially an issue of the class being so short; more time to review = the option to have longer pilots, rather than only accepting half hour pilots in order to allow students to review five different submissions within three days.) Since half hour dramas are unconventional, I asked one of our mentors, JZ (who is great) for examples.The responsibility should not be on the Mentors to find out-- information like that should be included in the prompt; if not discussed in depth, then at least as a link or list of examples to research on your own if you have the time + desire to do so. Especially since the assignment boils down to ""break convention with no examples of successful scripts in this fashion."" In a class presumably allowing beginningeres/greenhorns to participate, this is irresponsible and flawed teaching.The same goes of the ""hints"" that are periodically posted (though again, appreciated!) by mentors in the forums-- those definitions and explanations should be included in the meat of the class, not as supplemental elements. In all honesty, if I didn't have prior experience with writing, I oftentimes wouldn't have any idea what was being discussed by the professor. (And one trip through the forums will illustrate that I am not the only one.)The assignments and due dates are oddly crunched together (another time constraint issue, I understand), but the Instructor's videos seem to imply that we should be receiving feedback before proceeding each time? Maybe in a longer course that would work, but here, I didn't even receive written feedback initially, so it would have been a mistake to wait for some to revise by before forging ahead.If this class isn't going to provide a solid foundation to build on, then it should be made clear, upfront. There is nothing wrong with an experience based / motivation-focused class, but that aspect needs to be transparent. ""We will not provide 101 teachings/readings."" This isn't a class; it's a workshop. It's a makerspace at best. I expected insight and some level of instruction.In one of the lectures, the Instructor literally says:""I'm not a big fan of some of the classic story structures, defining in what must happen in each act. Or the problem, the twist, the resolution, rising action, denouement, fine action, etc."" He does not define these terms, nor allude to them ever again. These are key benchmarks in screenwriting. Definitions would be helpful for someone just starting out, even if the Instructor doesn't strictly want us to abide by them. His students should leave the class more informed than when they came.Unless you're lucky and receive a response from a mentor or someone with visible background in script writing, the reviews don't amount to much, because very few enrollees seem to know what is going on enough to provide a meaty assessment. That is the fault of the course, I think, rather than my peers. Likewise, The grading system here is atrocious because of it; few people understand the foundation, and thusly don't know how to format or structure. So to then be graded on a purely pass or fail basis (that, looking through the forums, many students weren't even AWARE of until the first review grades rolled in) is ridiculous. And I am saying that as someone that scored 100% on both assignments that I did stay to complete, so this is not a case of sour grapes, but an observation of inefficiency.I understand that the class is based around ""Active Learning"", but for active learning to work and bear fruit, students should be able to engage with/analyze/synthesize/evaluate/build upon class content. Which necessitates actual, meaningful content. Content beyond my fellow confused peers, and 2 minute videos illustrating various ways of saying ""Write Something Interesting and if it isn't Interesting, people won't care."" Not exactly an astute observation that we couldn't glean anywhere but this course.Honestly, my 4th Edition copy of ""The Screenwriters Bible"" is five times more helpful than this course, and it is about six years out of date.",2

The lectures waste a good share of time as in places they barely scratch the surface of what is further required to be implemented in the assignments. The assignments themselves inherit the nice modular spec-test driven spirit of the first two classes. However, the instructions are mostly quite vague or even misleading, occasionally dropping some “hints”, which are often either not helpful, or just offer to copy-paste a quarter page of code. The tasks are very (and by “very"" I mean EXTREMELY) long, tedious, boring to tears and to the point when you start to wonder if the authors are trolling the students. How about a 53 (yes, that is fifty three!) pages of assignment for the 3d week? To be fair, not all of this is the task statement, there is a lot of test code as well, but you know.. even one third of 53 is an impressive volume for a 4 weeks course (you get re-enrolled if you fail to be fair). Took me 44 hours of pure coding time (according to WakaTime) to finish the course. I have passed tens of courses on Coursera, and this one is by far the worst. That is taking into consideration that I would not rather call any other course (of those I have taken) “a bad one”. I suggest saving time and money by buying a book on Mongo and another one on Rails instead. I do believe though that the course is very green and certainly has to undergo some refinements and I will be happy to see future reviews shadow this one as obsolete.",2
2673,the course is a bit outdated and I am finding it hard to stay motivated knowing there are other more recent courses. The topics I think are still relevant but the tools are not. I am looking for courses where there is hands on development that you follow with the instructor and I did not find this here.,2

53848,"In my opinion, the sound quality is quite low and this makes it difficult to follow the lectures smoothly. And I found the current response in the FQA section of the course to this problem very unusefull and discouraging... .I am guessing that the course is not really meant for absolute beginners and some previous knowledge of programming and such is needed. I did not have any knowledge in those areas and I found it hard to follow everything mentioned in the course. So, I switched to another course on a different platform to be able to make the best of my time.",2
16163,"Unsyncronize subtitle with audio. Please fix thisIMO, I think the video must not too long. (below 10 minutes/video), so lecturer separated it to more segment. And give pop-up quiz in video",2
63295,"As it is, unfortunetly I can only rate it as a 2/5. The lectures are presented in a reasonable way, but this is a somewhat technical course, for wich additional materials would need to be mandatory. There are no slides for the lectures, the instructor mentions chapters of a book and does not provide the materials to students pursue a more effective way of studying the materials. Also, the quizzes are excessively challeging taking into consideration that the only resource availble to students are the videos. In my opinion, presenting a course that only has videos is not an effective way of learning. To make this course more effective and to allow students to learn more effectivelly and get some learning objectives, more material besides the videos must be made available. As it is, no more than a 2/5 is possible to rate this course.",2
16828,Professors accent very hard to understand. Week 5's lesson should be reviewed as may have no place in class,2
69854,"The lessons are sometimes completely disconected from the graded assignments. There were some graded assignements that dealt with things I have never heard about and I completed it without even looking the lessons videos. Some of the lessons are disapointing of the lack of assistance to the required software/code to be used. In such a way that the concept worked is very simple, but if you have no experience on the software or code you can have a hard time to complete the assignements with irritating details which are not explained at all in the lessons. The lessons serves more as a guide to what you should search in google and learn through other source of information. I did not expected such poor course from a paid one; I have doen free courses way better than this course. Don´t pay or this course, find some other course free or other paid course with better reviews.",2
101904,Instructor was good. Content of whole program was focused on analytics. Perhaps a better title for this course is Social Media Analytics.,2
69876,Unrelated and incohesive lectures. Disappointed. Lots of random topics talked about .but nothing in depth.,2
10884,"The content of the course so far is interesting - and to be fair, I've only completed the first week of this course.Unfortunately, the combination of multiple lecturers within one part of a lesson (often with highly varying accents, reading verbatim from lecture notes) makes the presentation of the course material come off as very stiff, over-directed, and hard to understand. It's hard to adapt to the idiosyncrasies and lecturing style of a new person in a four minute video, at which point you get a whole new lecturer and have to start the process over again.A maximum of two or three lecturers for the entirety of the course (perhaps with the occasional guest speaker) would be helpful. Also, either allowing the them to deliver the course material in their native languages with English subtitles, or perhaps having them record the course material in English in something similar to a classroom environment where they're accustomed to lecturing, would make things infinitely easier to follow.This 'too many cooks in the kitchen' issue is what I also suspect happened with the week one quiz. I do not know who generates the quiz questions but they seemed to require a lot of mental gymnastics for a multiple choice quiz. Perhaps on my end there could be a cultural misunderstanding in how a quiz checks your knowledge of the source material? Let me put it this way: in my previous university studies, I have never taken a multiple choice quiz where the question starts as 'In your opinion...'Sadly, I will probably drop this class - but the course has sparked enough of an interest where I will probably be picking up some books or doing some informal research on my own about this topic.",2

I know I'm under-utilizing them at present, and there's good stuff there.In spite of claims to the contrary, the Lexalytics and IBM Bluemix videos did feel like extended infomercials. Moreover, I work for a small non-profit, and we have neither the funds or bandwidth to utilize programs like this. I think the time could have been better used doing a deeper dive with Klout and SocialMention. I'm working on the assignment now and feel like we barely scraped the surface with both of these programs.There are just too many tools being introduced in this MOOC, and not enough practical learning.

The marking system was inaccurate, for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasn't! Good, solid advice about setting character, scene and place and ideas to help you out of writer's block. The two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience.

As having good knowledge will never be equals to able to produce good students. Personally, I feel that you should lower down yourself and speak to the level of your students/audience. Use more simple examples, draw a big picture in our minds on what is this course all about, what are we going to achieve, in each of the topics, what are we going to look at and what methods available.For foundation class like this, I think few simple examples and introducing one or two useful methods in each topic would be more than sufficient to us. The objective should be providing us with the basic knowledge, get us interested in this subject, and able to apply those well taught basic knowledge. As when we are interested, for sure we will go and do more research, and some might even would like to move on to intermediate or advance levels.The key point here is ""speak to the level of your audience"".

While this forces more independent learning, it also makes it so that this course isn't really much better than free online tutorials. I found myself learning almost everything for the programming assignments from the pandas package documentation and from Google searches that led to stackoverflow. For an instructor from the University of Michigan whose bio says ""I work with colleagues to design tools to better the teaching and learning experience in higher education,"" I was expecting a lot more value for the time spent in this class. I suspect that this course is being used to provide data for furthering his own research. It's often more difficult to maximize value to customers when personal incentives may not be perfectly aligned with customer (student) objectives.",2
41462,Could not get through the first week. Way too much emphasis on BlueJ and Duke University specific libraries.

Because of this I would only recommend this course if you already have an intermediate level in Python.",2

68189,"The content of this course is interesting, I liked the examples, and the material gave an interesting overview of different aspects of machine learning. From that perspective, the course is as advertised. But, where this course goes wrong is value for money - it is very superficial and not worth what is charged.As noted by others, this is not a course for learning so much as an advertisement for the instructor's own pay software and their other Coursera courses. I'm not against that per say if it was entirely free, but charging for an advertisement is ridiculous. In my case I thankfully started with the free model so I didn't lose out, but I could see others being dissapointed. I strongly recommend starting the material with a free signup and only pay if you really want the extra grading.My other main problem was with the pace and detail in the course. I would have liked more detail, but I recognize this was intended to be a high level view so I'll live with that level of detail. The material covered, however, does not need 6 weeks worth of lectures. This course could be ~1/2 as long, cover the same material, and be a MUCH better course.Other small problems include some poorly edit videos (there are a lot of examples of simple stumbling in the videos that should have meant they do another take), very short videos (maybe a person preference, but the number of <2 minute videos here is annoying, especially when there's a 5-second standard video at the start and end of all videos). All in all, there's just a lot of wasted time.When signing up for this course I was really excited for the entire specialization - now, not so much. I'll probably try the second course in the series (for free to start) to see if things improve, but ironically this advertisement video has if anything turned me off their other products.",2
31916,"This course has valuable information, but it is ultimately political. The professors don't even disclose that there are two opposing historical schools: ""New Historians,"" whom Palestinians reference; and traditional historians, favored by most Israelis. Which version is followed here? The answer is a mix, without identification. This is not the same as ""balance,"" which would entail each side laying out its key points and evidence. As others note, there is zero reading material. One wonders if this is because to choose a historian is to choose sides--that is how divisive this topic is. The discussion forums are also poorly monitored, unlike other Coursera courses; which does not advance understanding.""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" unfortunately applies to this condensed intro course. And contrary to expectations for an offering from Tel Aviv U., most Israelis would likely be offended by some of its assertions/omissions. For example, Israelis recall that Palestinian founding father Haj Amin al-Husseini was a Nazi agitator in Europe and bequeathed an anti-Jewish ideology (Netanyahu even made a speech about this in 2015 that was covered internationally). Yet in this course, you will be told simply that al-Husseini was a ""man of religion.""",2

Instead, it is a lecture from Power Points, that don't really line up with the assignments very well.If you have previous knowledge in another language, you'll do fine, but if you're truly looking for a beginner course, look elsewhere.

67209,"I found the course rather difficult, with respect to the other courses I did on Coursera. In my opinion part of the reason I found it difficult is that the material is not explained very well. Hinton is certainly a guru in Machine Learning, but I found him a bit boring as a teacher and often I thought he was explaining some details but failing to give the broader picture. I must admit I did not read the extra material provided with the course (the long articles) but only focused on the videos, slides and tests, perhaps had I read the articles I would have struggled less. I also did the course in 9 weeks instead of 16, but I did watch most videos twice so I feel I did dedicate some time to it. I much preferred Andrew Ng's course, and I strongly recommend doing that one first. I am also loving the University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization, but since I have been wating for the next course in that specialization for a while, I did Hinton's course in the mean time. That said, I did find this course useful, although I often felt somewhat frustrated.",2

Yes, it mentioned ""alternative"" approach (which is much more popular than GraphLab), but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through. With scikit-learn as a great open source package, the only reason (I suspect) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose. For me, if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas, I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn; but now, it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly.

11132,"What I liked: Materials have quality and a professional approach. Speakers add value to the discussion. Toolkit is important.What I didn't like: This course, as most of Northwestern courses, is excessively short in video lectures per module. In this course each module had about 20 to 30 minutes of videos per module. That is clearly insufficient. Most courses in Wharton's, U. Michigan's and Illinoi's specializations in Coursera, have more video materials per module, than your courses in totality... 1.5 to 3 hours per module in the three institutions mentioned in average per module against about 2 hours of videos on all your course modules combined. That is a serious and very salient gap, that I think you should reflect on. In my opinion, quality MOOC's either singular courses, either specializations have to be very well balanced in content - both in quality and quantity. Your courses have very reasonable quality, but fails completely in quantity. As competition in the online e-learning domain increases at an impressive speed, you should benchmark what I mentioned above and do something about it, or probably after 2/3 runs of your courses, people with churn for more addedd value offerings in the dimensions that I pointed out.Good luck.",2
90541,The course is poorly organised: There is a project on week one that requires knowledges of week two.

The reason for the low rating was the 6th module, and the fact that I felt very ill prepared for the syntax of creating all the operations in Spark (building out the Jupiter notebook). We really did not cover much of that, and it was quite punishing to search the web and sources to make things work. Even the instructions to export the csv file were misleading at best. I have a full time job and a family, I am not some young undergraduate with copious amounts of time to waste. While I am not opposed to some searching of other sources, I would like to have more of the useful information taught so that it is not so much of a burden.

In one type, the professor is in a lab or kitchen or classroom or something and is physically demonstrating things. These videos are useful and mostly understandable. The other type of videos are lecture-style things that appear to have literally been sliced out of some other more thorough set of videos - sometimes the professor refers back to ""earlier"" parts of the lecture that we haven't actually seen before. Concepts and variables are often introduced without even mentioning what they refer to.",2

The content can be used for introducing and familiarizing with clinical practice with ASD. But this course has the limitation on following grounds1. The contents of the course are coloured with medical perspective and with pathological view point2. At some point this course appeared like an advertisement for the institute and its research work3. This course tried to cover too many things like theory, practice, research, experience and so on. But at the end it failed to do justice all4. Finally the contents are infected with virus of medicine, market and military science. Terms such as intervention, package, therapy so many terminology.

The delivery of the lectures needs a lot of work, with distracting, erratic pauses between words, and the sound frequently cutting out mid-word as they switch between slides. I found it difficult to make it through more than 15 minutes of content.I gave more than 1 star because the links underneath the slides contain some valuable information, so if you can be bothered trawling through the slides you can gleam some knowledge there.Hopefully the creators of the course take on board the many negative reviews and give a major overhaul to the course, to bring it in line with the quality of almost all other content on Coursera.",2
62433,"I think the content was quite interesting; as someone new to marketing, I was really looking forward to the lectures and exercises. However, the content was simply too much for me to complete. It's a bit ironic that a course about marketing missed its market. To give a bit more detail: there were 12 video lectures, 3 assignments that had to be done days before the end of the week to be peer-reviewed, and then I had to peer review others work, while also going through all the assigned reading. It seemed more like a courseload for a full time student or perhaps a part-time student. As online students typically are neither, I'm surprised the course content wasn't better managed. I take a lot of notes, so perhaps that's what slowed me down, but I also have a full time job and I intern on the weekends. I was hoping this course could easily be done in the evening hours. Other coursera courses provided an excellent balance of content and courseload, I'm disappointed that this course wasn't one of them. It seemed very useful and interesting.",2
62762,"I had high expectations of this course, but must admit I'm pretty disappointed. Navigating the course feels unintuitive and clunky. Not sure if that's just a Coursera thing though. The actual content (video) looks great, but is unfortunately exceedingly brief, so much so, that it feels like this entire course could have just been a single article. In fact, there's not much presented that really benefits from the video format. Most 'instruction' in the course is centered around brief talks, or artist interviews, and thus you're often just looking at two people talking, or an artist showing you their work while they talk. You never even see anyone draw to my recollection.The 'work' in the course feels rather 'phoned in' at times too. Questions such as ""What did you find interesting about the video you just watched?"" seem unnecessary, and too elementary to contain any real value, especially when the videos are so brief.Having said all that, I DO think the people who made it are genuine, and have passion for comics, and comics education, and I'll continue to follow their efforts on that front.",2

Unfortunately, in quality it's closer to the latter: mixed quality, lectures that seem unrelated to their corresponding assignments, many errors (both typos and, more seriously, examples that don't type-check!) and a general lack of an in-depth motivation for the principles. Staff participation in my run of the course (2016) was disappointingly low; in some cases there was no response at all to students pointing out glaring errors in the lectures.It's very noticeable that this course is a patchwork of previous courses. In same cases the video lectures even display the wrong title for the course, or mention lectures that no longer exist in this version of the course!The course has interesting parts (I was especially thrilled when I saw there were lectures about FRP), but its quality is way below ""Functional Programming Principles in Scala"". I'm disappointed.To make this review constructive, my recommendations:1- Pay attention to quality. Make sure all examples compile and type-check.2- Make sure you're not repeating content already in other courses, especially if they are part of the same specialization!3- If you're going to re-use content from other contents, make sure it fits the current course.

6615,"I enjoyed and benefitted from some of this course. In particular I would highly recommend the Meditation Labs, the Science of Meditation videos and the short presentations from the Tibetan Buddhist monks . But I think the creators of this course need to be a lot clearer about what their aims are in that part of the course which Dr Germano presented. Since this was he was presenting the main overview of Buddhist content it was particularly disappointing that his presentations were so bad.I understand that there were difficulties in getting the course up and running from the various delays in its starting date and the change to its title and perhaps Dr Germano's role was more affected than the other lecturers. However it's pretty damning when he manages to to be so off-putting to so many of the students, going on the discussion comments. For my own part, I've studied and practiced Buddhism for more than 30 years and I am left with little sense of what his aims were for his lectures.To be more specificDr Germano's Presentation:-he read from what I presume were lecture notes but more likely he was reading from an academic paper. the language was pretty turgid.-he could have just provided a PDF of his paper / notes for us to download. That would have been much more helpful as presumably it would have had some structure to it. doing that would have enabled him to use his video time in a more creative way.-MOOCs are wonderful audio-visual opportunities but he had no slides or illustrations at all. The few text headers which appeared then disappeared in only a very few seconds and sometimes did not relate directly to what he was saying at that time.Dr Germano's content: the amended title was Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. This is a complex subject which encompasses many layers of meditation practice culled from historically earlier Buddhist traditions. Can I suggest that any future version of this course includes the following:-include a video which presents the main aspects of the historical development of Buddhism. There was some mention of this in Germano's material but he did it from the Tibetan point of view. Surely what a modern day presentation needs is a modern impartial historical analysis of the subject. It's not as if there aren't plenty of academics and practitioners who are active in this field.-it's confusing to describe Tibetan Lesser Vehicle practices but then illustrate them with Pali text sources, modern Mindfulness practice, and modern Brahma Vihara practice all of which have emerged from the modern Theravadin tradition.-it's also perplexing to include information about many modern Theravadin teachers (Sayadaw, Goenka) in a course apparently not about them.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the videos about Sayadaw and the interview with Sharon Saltzberg, but I am left in the dark about just what differences, if any, there are between them and Tibetan meditation.Overall I think this course was offered prematurely. Much of its content was enthralling, inspiring and very useful practically. However much of it was not.",2

The professor did not do that and that got me wondering (not knowing) how to calculate the formulas. I think if I had seen a few examples, it would have been enough to understand and keep up.So, more step-by-step instructions on the mechanics of formulas, would be my biggest recommendation.But the professor did a superb job explaining the concepts, and showcasing some industry applications of the models.Thank you for asking.",2

I'm not sure if I was just jarred by the change in instructor, but I found her manner of lecture to be almost belittling. I'm not sure if she's a mother or not, but that's the way she comes across--like she's trying to squeeze massive and advanced theory into a pill designed for ten year-olds.A majority of this class simply glossed over things we already learned in the intro class, and she would often list things she was going to talk about, and then ignore one of those items entirely. In fact, one of the most challenging assignments in this course was building a journey map, something that was mentioned in the lectures, but not gone into in depth at all. I tackled this challenge by sort of haphazardly googling journey maps and praying my submission would come across as somewhat logical.Ultimately I'm very disappointed with this part of the specialization. I don't feel like it was worth my $39, and would love to see this class completely redesigned for future learners. Research and prototyping is arguably one of the most important things for a burgeoning UX designer to learn, and this class could stand to be a lot more in depth.",2

I strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses, not 5 (with the capstone).

The pre-processing of the data was quite extensive (9 steps before generating the ngram tables I used in my model) and was the key to getting decent results IMHO, but one had to step on a quite a few landmines to figure this out.The problem was an interesting one and I ended up reworking it after passing with 95% (the only class in the specialization I didn't get 100% on) because I didn't have time to implement much of what I had to figure out by 'hard-knocks'",2
21159,Course content and assignments were difficult to follow. Loads of statistical content along with high-level R content means it was probably the toughest of the 4 I have taken so far in the Coursetrack.,2
51558,"While I love Dr. van Lent's teaching style, I was somewhat disappointed in the course as a whole. After about the first week the instructor was not heard from again on the forums. It wasn't until about the last week that some official teaching staff started to make an appearance.This was an issue as, especially in the first week, as there was a good deal of discrepancy between what was on the grading rubric, what was provided in description for the homework, and what was in an optional video that described the homework. All with no official direction as to what was correct, or how things should be properly graded. The students were just left to themselves to try and interpret what the instructor meant, and what was the proper thing to do in regards to the peer grading. This continued, albeit to a far lesser extent, through the remainder of the course.While I don't expect instructors to be in the forums all that often, I do expect them to clear up obvious issues, and to make some type of official statement as to how students should proceed. I believe this was the first offering of this course, and I hope as it offered again those discrepancies are fixed, and perhaps more official teaching staff are able to monitor the forums.As far as the material itself, it is pretty good, and covers most of the basics well. As I said at the start, I really love Dr. van Lent's teaching style. She is very encouraging, and easy to understand. She is also very human, making mistakes as she goes along, and correcting them. I feel this gives the student a good experience of the real world iterative process that coding is, that even with experience mistakes are still made, and to be expected, and how to go about doing some debugging to correct those mistakes.",2

I'm not sure why, there was a disconnect somewhere, I think maybe that I didn't receive the help that I feel I still need on the subject of how to create a great, memorable, believable character. Also, some of the assignments were confusing. Nothing really stands out about this course, and it was actually a bit boring and I don't feel I learned anything related to the subject. Everything about this class needs some work: the videos, the instruction/syllabus/content, and the assignments. Sorry, I didn't like it. =(",2

Even after having submitted my final assignment and peer reviewing others, it is not clear whether or not I or any of my classmates used the correct methods to complete the assignment. A valid solution to the final project hasn't even been given to us as part of the course, so I'll never know whether or not I did it correctly.",2

Teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized, technical issues are common, and the discussion forums do not offer much value, as you cannot discuss your code with your peers, and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful. The exercises are unoriginal and do not require much creative thinking - often it's enough to copy & paste code from the lectures and change a few variables around! You're better of looking for other Python beginner courses on the Coursera platform, as well as on other platforms. The only thing I liked about the course were the interviews with people behind Python, but otherwise the course does not facilitate deeper learning and is not engaging.",2

I often wonder if anyone on the UCSD/Coursera side ever actually tries to complete the assignments. The quiz is missing key links and the questions read as if they were written by someone who's first language is not English. Pretty sloppy effort.",2

I would appreciate if they were double checked before release.",2
103995,The lectures for this course seem unorganized and often had poor audio. The content covered in many lectures seemed off topic. Quiz questions would then focus on the off topic information making it confusing with regard to what material to focus on during a lecture. Do I focus on the proposed subject of the video or the many tangents about other topics. This combined with the unorganized nature of videos(just winging it) made the lectures distracting. The lecture videos are full of code that simply does not work in the real world and help from staff takes literally days to get(and not just over the weekend).,2

35446,"The lectures were not very interesting or instructive. The reading materials were much more so. However, the assignments in the class were based much more on the lectures and on self-reflection than on the materials. I learned a little bit, and as such found the course worth the time I put into it, but I almost think one could get through this course with little difficulty without reading any of the written materials, and thus derive very little benefit from it. I would encourage the makers of this course to do a significant revamping.(In addition to greater incorporation and emphasis on the written materials, I think more real-life examples of diplomatic successes and failures would be a far more effective and entertaining use of the lecture time than the esoteric philosophising that seems to characterize it in this edition.)",2
12895,Very very broad with no real depth. Basically a very light summary of what cybersecurity is. You could watch all of the videos in 30 min probably. The real course comes from the reading and peer discussions.,2

17105,"When going through the Theory course, I often wondered why the assignments are so abstract and theoretical, and I thought that maybe when we come to practice, we will be able to do something with our hands. No way! While reinforcing the theoretical background (mostly repeating same postulates from the Theory course), this course contributes very little to its name (practice). Only the last module on presenting goes a little further than making you ponder on abstract themes. This is surprising - there are lots of practical tools discussed in the course, and you have no opportunity to get hands on at least one of them (except Google Trends) and evaluate it, at least for primitive purposes. Why does the teacher not take the example of the brilliant Aric Rindfeisch's course Marketing in the Digital World with really well-crafted practical assignments?",2

63698,"It was a very enjoyable course up till the end of module three where things went a bit awry; mosty due to the unexplained withdrawal of the discussion forem and the failure of the third party platform to perform correctly at 123D (which left us doing assignments that couldn't be completed with the assigned tools).A big part of the fourth module was about connecting and communicating with the internet via ethernet and wifi. That was a bit lost on me, mainly because i didn't really appreciate why i should want to (I can understand many reasons, but none felt very close at hand). I think it would have been more enjoyable with useful examples and practice.Ok, the course is still worth doing, but i think there is much room for creating a smooth and enjoyable learning process. It felt more like a beta version.",2

25536,"I will review this course appointing its pros and cons.Pros:- The instructor: he is a captivating person. It really seems that he like game development, he make jokes and try to make the course interesting. So, he’s personality is makes the course less boring.Cons:- The course name: when I saw “design” in the course name and the icon of course page, I thought it would be related to graphic design, or history telling and so on. But no, the “design” means “project”. So I think a better name would be “Principles of Game Project”. Although, it might be just me who thought this way, because in my language design means something totally different.- The course content: this course should be at the end of the specialization. It is too much abstract and, in some aspects, very obvious. I will not say it is completely useless, because it is not. It gives us a structured view of the stages of game design and its documentation, but I think it would be better if it was like a case study.- The assignments: probably the worst part of the course. They very very complex, to be sincere, none of the assignments I reviewed were full, I gave max grades to many because I think the person tried really hard to make it. Imagine this situation: you are not a programmer, not a graphic designer, not a writer and with a week you need to make a prototype of the game idea you’ve been working on course. This prototype must show the game mechanics and aesthetics, should be playable… And can be non digital? Come on, we are here learning the concepts of developments digital games and the instructor says that we can make a non digital prototype? Some people did it, and I can say for sure that I couldn’t imagine the real game. I made a digital prototype using the knowledge acquired from the first course, but as you can imagine, it is not enough to make our game ideas come true.- The peer review system: the grading is completely non sense, as I said before, the assignments are complex, so it is difficult to show our ideas clearly in a document, without the abilities to make concept arts or something. In 2 of the 4 assignments 2 of the 3 people gave me max grades and 1 gave me bad grades, and did not left any feedback! One of the assignments when I first submitted it I got 12/20. Then, when I resubmitted it, without changing a comma, I got 20/20. So I think this system must change, maybe the mentor should do it.If you want to do all the specialization, ok, go and do this course. But, if this is not your objective, do not waste your time.",2
98623,Turned out to be a course in financials rather than modeling. The whole specialization could have been designed to make better progress in modeling.,2
14813,"The course is well structured and provides a good introduction, however, I expected a bit more from a course that costs 20 pounds than just a few clips on how to install and set-up software/create a github account etc. This information is available for free online on the websites of the respective software.I understand that such an introduction is needed for the course, but then do not offer it as a separate 20 pound module. Instead include it for free with any other 'specialization' you can buy.",2

19473,"I took onus with a number of ideas/concepts offered, simply because they are either misrepresentative of SM or untrue. First, the the ""prof"" who talked about visuals OVERPLAYED the role of visuals online. The Internet began as a text communications vehicle, not a medium to share graphics (etc). The rise of video, images only grew as the technology evolved to allow easy distribution. Words are still key online--are there ANY websites major who do not use words? In fact, for many of the good ones, visuals take a secondary role to the actual written content. Second, the section about joining a community and then faking your way to gaining credibility by posing as a newbie etc--especially by marketers--is highly reviled by many SM communities. As an INFLUENCER who has been approached by many marketers in the past decade ""to help them understand something"" (etc) I can tell you, we do suss you out quickly and treat you appropriately. We are not here to provide free consulting to make you feel or look competent or knowledgeable (as we would for real members of a community). I contacted a friend who's an influencer in different communities to me, with what your ""expert"" suggested. He, too, was not happy with what was in this unit. If you want to know why marketers have a bad rep? It's because of bad advice given in webinars like this one. I am so glad I did not pay for this course.",2

This might be ok, but the difficulty of assignments should follow; instead, they can be relatively hard; newbie programmers will probably have an extremely hard time solving them, considering that many of the problems they will encounter are not treated at all in the course.The course does not focus enough on what differentiates R from other languages: just a few videos on data types, *apply functions, and a tiny little bit of scoping (very unclear). All these areas should have been expanded, and the course should have had more arguments as well.Finally, the assignments are not enough and their grading system is quite poor: instead of submitting your code and testing it automatically, you should calculate some quantities by hand and select the results out of a few possibilities.All in all, I was disappointed with the course.",2
62431,"This course dedicates an entire week to very simple topics. The lectures could use some serious editing too. To help you understand what I expect, I'm taking this at the same time as I'm taking Wharton's Week 1 Entrepreneurship program. I've also taken Wharton's Intro to Marketing course which I highly suggest over this course. The quality is dramatically better. Getting Started: Agile Meets Design Thinking is a University of Virginia course that also is a great example of how these courses should be done. I'm hoping the next courses in the Digital Marketing Capstone are much better so that I'm not watching a lecture and counting how many times the professor pushes his glasses back up.On the plus side, I did like the engagement this course encourages by forcing you to go to other websites & accomplish things as well as review your peers work. I wish your peer reviews had less of an outcome on your grade though. In my experience, many people did not even read the instructions on how to review the assignments.",2

Either way, I didn't feel like she liked what she was doing.These were good tips for people in a new business management position, but honestly this was all stuff you learn while socializing with people. They are generally good social skills that every one should have. I learned little to nothing while taking this class. But, as I said, most of this is directed towards to someone in a management position. I guess this would be helpful when having to work with someone who is a drama-maker, although, fortunately, I have not had a situation yet with someone who creates drama. Yes, I know people who create drama, however, there have been no blowouts or severe problems. Maybe this is the reason why I didn't learn anything in this class... :-(",2

This high fidelity, digital work could even be optional, but I need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should look.Even being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first 7 sections would be helpful.The review is kind of about what you are looking to get out of these classes.

There's a bit of a tour of XCode, but it's not particularly comprehensive. The apps you build are incredibly basic, and there's no real discussion of how to generalize from them.3) Is the course presented in an engaging way? 1/5This course is super boring. If you already know C, a lot of the content is a waste of time, but I imagine that if you don't know C this is not a good way to pick it up.So overall 2/5One other thing - the assignments are graded in a pretty bizarre way. You have to take a screencap video of your code and your app in action, upload the video, and then wait for another person to enroll in the course and review your submission.

5446,"Honestly, I find it very hard to recommend this course to anyone. First of all, let's note that the course covers quite more advanced topics than the previous 3 courses in the specialization, so some extra difficulty is to be expected. However, the main problem I encountered was with the video lectures themselves, particularly during the 3rd and 4th week of the course. The instructor does a very rushed job at explaining everything, constantly giving us tons of information and jargon that is not previously mentioned, and even the examples fail to give us insight at what we need to do and why.Other than the lectures, no external material is given to help us decipher what the professors are saying, other than a few Wikipedia links. I'm not saying that each course should be accompanied by an e-book, but honestly, if I wanted to learn about Bayesian Statistics from Wikipedia I could have well skipped this class.The main reason I'm giving 2 stars to the course instead of 1 is the Labs and the Quizzes. Even though they could use some polishing too, especially the final Lab, they are indeed very helpful and do a much better job at clarifying the concepts presented.All in all, I feel that if you want to learn about Bayesian Statistics you should look for another course, and/or save your money and get yourselves a good textbook.",2

12067,"Lectures were extremely good, but assignments and graders were very low quality and difficult to decipher requirements from. Professors and TAs were not active in the forums.",2
94799,"The scope of the course is interesting, the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine, but the contents and quizzes are very often off-point. A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents. Affirmations are most times not justified at all (""incremental prototyping will yield a feature-rich and robust software""). The quizzes some times ask about things which have nothing to do with what was explained before. The contents about SCRUM are presented eight times partially through the introduction and here. I know it takes a lot of time to prepare this material, but clearly that last effort for quality was not done.",2
19749,Very basic info suited for highschool students. Many errors in transcripts that you will just have to slog through.,2
71814,"you have access to the material, but you have to pay 80 USD to take simple quizzes....",2
99586,"The slides are not at all helpful. Unfortunately, this is a far less useful course than the companions in the specialization. The quizzes tend to be glitchy, and have a maddening propensity to have users type formulas,",2
65136,"Initially I thought this was a great course, but my optimism quickly dissipated. The homework assignments all required information that wasn't covered in the lectures, forcing hours of searching for answers. During the week, questions in the forums were answered within a day or so, but there was no help at all on the weekends. If I got stuck on a Friday night and couldn't find an answer myself, I had to wait until Monday to get a reply from an instructor or teaching assistant. For those who work during regular business hours and use their free time on the weekends to study, this course becomes nearly impossible to complete.",2
92971,"I do not like how the lecturer teaches. It is too theoretical, and from very simple concepts makes rocket science. It would be better to have more exmaple and less theory.",2
107010,"For those interested in taking exams, these questions were poorly worded and it was evident that the person writing the questions in English was not proficient in the English Language. The material was interesting and up to date, but much was lost in translation.",2
6471,"Content was good, but occasionally VERY hard to understand the lecturers' English. Worth taking though.",2
103301,"Course material and contents are quite interesting but, grading system specially peer review method is absolutely disappointing and kills the motivation. Grading level by other students somehow looks insulting regarding the time and effort which I put to think, write, explain and make videos.",2
1786,"I do not think that students should need to pay for a course in order to watch interviews with previous graduates. Half of this course should have been condensed or excluded. There is not much to learn in these modules. It was decent, but it was not a five star course. I think the ratings on this are misleading.",2
81926,Leaves out so much of basic stuff. I think this course is for 4th graders.,2
78763,"After about week 6, helpfulness decreased quite a lot..",2
79859,"The course is not interactive enough, it's a waterfall of dry information. I'd expected more based on the generally good reviews. Say, more examples, better videos. Think twice before buying.",2
39199,This course had too much content in one-run and some of the topic-assignments had too much confusing questions and answers which were hard to figure out made this course a bit a bad experience. The same goes for the end-assignment project where much functionality was required within a short time -- and the course was delayed so many of the students could not fit it into their schedule.,2
99640,the quiz is so frustrating,2
61531,I am taking the Digital Marketing Specialization and this has been the poorest course I have taken thus far. The instructor is obviously reading directly from a script because of her constant long pauses between words and how frequently she gets lost when presenting information. She also clicks to new slides and bullet points at the wrong time which is very disruptive. The information presented on the slides really does not summarize what she is saying at all and I constantly had to refer to the transcript to get the information I needed to write down.The assesment questions for this course are also quite poor and a lot of the time need to be further researched online. The quiz questions also seem more involved than the lectures presented and can need some researching as well. I was looking forward to this course and I am disappointed. The instruction for this course seems like she does not the subject well enough to provide insight and quite possibly as if this is the first time she is giving a lecture/presentation.,2
27942,"The amount of information covered in this course is just right for a beginner. But it suffers because one, the lectures are boring and lifeless (can you imagine graphics design being BORING?), and two, the examples are UNINSPIRING. They could've done better than use the same circles, squares and triangles to explain various concepts! It's hard to get excited about a topic when the presentation is this dull. And did I mention the lecturer doesn't even look directly at the viewer? It's like they're looking at a monitor or camera on the side, so it's like he's talking to somebody else.So in summary, basic concepts and information are there, yes. And it's free so take it and check out the others in the series. It's just that execution could've been a lot better.",2
23731,Too simplistic if you already have some knowledge about a healthy lifestyle,2
16909,too complicated,2
67409,I honestly thought this course was all over the place and too general. It also seemed to be full of self - congratulations about what UPENN has accomplished with its research. I wanted more depth in a more targeted approach to improving my life.,2
39224,Confusing assignment instructions were frustrating. The lack of response to questions was disappointing and stressful. I took the HCI course in 2014 that was precursor to this certificate program and it had a better flow and more organized.,2
90448,"This course seems 'light' in content - too much time is spent reviewing case studies instead of discussing different ways to create documents that enable reproducible research. Perhaps this should be a topic/chapter in another course, and not a standalone course.",2
83015,The support by the mentors could be much better. Because of the missing support I was not able to solve the assignments under Windows with Octave. I had to buy Matlab. (-2)It seems to me that the course is very difficult to complete without additional sources. (-1),2
79274,Somehow simple presentations.,2
61326,Material is outdated and course assignments failed to challenge thinking and encourage critical engagement with the content provided.,2
82830,"Very dry and uninspired.The lecturer monotonically reads off some material.The explanations don't usually make any sense.The quizzes are a guessing game, arbitrarily connected (or not) to the lecture material.In retrospect: a waste of my time.",2
103934,"I think this course could be much better without Jack Wu, laughing every few seconds. I would except more professional approach and not videos likely taken on first shot with errors.",2
79450,"The first course I was really dissappointed with. It came of as very subjective, unscientific and I could not take it seriously. Coursera usually has more credible courses.",2
17960,Very disappointed with this final course. Little to no support. Discussion Forum provides some level of help but you are basically on your own.Very challenging to come up to speed with Natural Language Processing techniques if you have never taken any class about it.My recommendation to JHU and Coursera is to add a separate course for NLP where you cover all the basics and then have the Capstone.,2
94490,"The professor doesn't explain clearly as part of the videos is his correcting himself or saying the same thing two or three times. And why must the videos show the teacher? It distracts from the slides and seeing him move doesn't help understand anything betterConcepts like VIF or hat values are not very well explained by the teacher, at least the SWIRL lesson explains it correctly. ANOVA and ANCOVA are mentioned in the description but they aren't explained anywhere. ANOVA is used without any explanation of what it is.I found myself searching online for other sources to understand the concepts.",2
6627,"I am afraid this is only two stars from me for now. It is a course with great content and a lot of potential, but the way how it is delivered can be greatly improved to make it easier to understand and more engaging. I just hope the team do not give up, but improve this to be one of the best courses on Coursera - it can well be!",2
8480,"Most of the course is providing useless statistics, i didn't enjoy it and it's a really basic course.",2
24129,"Too qualitative, too much theory, narrative.Needs more specific examples of how numbers are manipulated for e.g. in financial statement fraud. Perhaps show real data on how outlier transactions are spotted.",2
5560,The answers to the test questions can be improved significantly. Most of them can be both justified or refuted.,2
14863,"It is a nice introduction, but the material is barely worth a one week orientation lesson (I have completed it in about 4 hours with watching all the videos, taking detailed notes, and completing the quizzes for 100%) . Why should we pay for a specialization preview, we can read info about the separate courses on our own? I am really looking forward the next courses in the specialization since I really need a good course in statistics and this seems to be one, but the first course should be eliminated. The installation of R and github account videos should be added to the next course as an introduction.",2
10781,"Some profs are very good, some are terrible. The terrible ones need to improve their teaching skills and even language skills. As a native Chinese speaker, I find some of the lectures very boring.Good lectures are clear, concise, and right to the point.Good teachers make the learning experience effortless and fun, poor teachers make it like a torture.",2
24782,"Too simplistic and not enough real world examples. It was clear instructor regurgitated material directly off of the screen, offered zero highlights to real world experience or issues. Rather than wasting a couple hours listening to presentations, download the slides and read them yourself. Disappointing.",2
33214,"More interactive assignments using the parser would have been great. As it stands, the quizzes had mostly relevant content, but the lessons were anything but engaging. Having Colleen talk at the camera for 5-12 minutes per video got tedious really quick.",2
5677,"The programming exercises should not be optional. I still intend to do them, but now I passed the course with a 100% mark but only 10% of knowledge.",2
82174,"A very lightweight intro to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and a dash of Boostrap. The instructors barely introduce the topics, and then point out that we don't need them, we can just ""Google or Yahoo"" for the information.If you just need a shove to get you moving down a path, this might be helpful, or if you are brand new to HTML, this would be a relatively painless way to check it out. I'm just not sure there is enough hand holding over the difficult bits for someone brand new to coding. The materials are pretty sparse and there is not much structure.All four weeks are available at the onset of the class and the entire class can be completed in a weekend.",2
20650,"I am a little disapointed with this course. I have completed the third week, but quizes are too big, and the questions are almost impossible to compare with the lectures.It seems like what is evaluated is your ability of getting languages nuances, and not the epidemiology subject.",2
4373,This class required far too much independent study. The instructor did not provide enough instruction or reading material to complete the quiz each week. There was too much focus on the conceptual data with very little emphasis on practical application of the material.,2
95679,"bunch of information, but the videos are tedious",2
41067,"This course, though fun, was not intensive at all. The main issue I have is probably with the Coursera structure itself. Many of your homework assignments are based off of if people can understand the instructions of the game- which, if you have mostly non-English speakers, sort of takes the homework from being ""be creative and challenge yourself"" to ""make sure everything you write down is 3 words max or else the people GRADING you won't understand it"". This is also true when looking at these students' games- when half of your grade depends on your clarity, these kids are ultimately at a disadvantage. I'm sure there were amazing games made by some of the non-English speaking students, but I wasn't able to understand and play many of them. It is fantastic that Coursera is open to everyone, but when your grades are based off of clarity of language, it gets tricky.",2
3246,"Extremely poor help and feedback.Almost no replies on discussion forums from mentors/peers so many issues end up unresolved. Considering how difficult this course is compared to other courses, the lack of real assistance is appalling.Seemingly outdated lessons.A lot of errors I get come from version discrepancies. Lessons should be checked over. If I have to Google problems to complete step-by-step lessons, the lesson is extremely ill-prepared.This is enough to make me abort this specialization.",2
83264,"It was way too theoretical, the concepts were not clearly explained, the tests had concepts that had not been explained and the teacher is not good explaining it, it is too monotonous",2
36089,"Very superficial teachings. This course seems aimed at non legal students, considering the very rare references to the legal instruments' articles. For the price paid, I could have found most information on Wikipedia... Furthermore, the staff isn't responding AT ALL to the —many—requests of the students regarding errors in the questionaries, deadline explanations, etc. Even worse, the subtitles to the videos are full of small typos and wrong transcriptions, sometimes changing the meaning of a sentence, thereby confusing the audience.",2
65133,"Unfortunately as a course designed to teach Rails, it is poorly paced and has a few issues. The course content is spread out over three weeks as follows...Week 1 they go over setting up a Ruby on Rails development environment, which was fine. They also went over Git and Github. While you can access all of the course content on Github, you are never actually required to use Git for any of the work in the course, and it only shows up as a few questions on the only quiz in the course.Week 2 they cover Ruby programming and syntax. There are a lot of different sources where you can find tutorials and such for learning a new language, and in this course the material was... good enough. They also offered a number of practice assignments with self grading capability which is a nice feature.The graded programming assignment for week 2 gives a lot of information about how to set up your environment and steps/commenting to assist building out your code. However there were a few requirements for the graded portion of the assignment that they don't even tell you about (expected return values under certain situations) until you actually run the grader. They weren't difficult but their reasoning were never explained in the course and it made the code a little more awkward than it needed be to pass.Week 3 is where the major pacing problems occur. There are a number of very broad stroke videos on Rails, as well as several brief videos covering a number of third party libraries or tools sometimes required to build Rail apps. A lot of the content they cover isn't even utilized in the assignments of the course.The week 3 assignment instructions are actually incomplete. They tell you a number of pre-required packages you have to install, including ones you had installed from previous assignments, but they leave out others you will need and leave several development environment issues you end up having to work out on your own.And where as the week 2 assignment was almost overly hand-holdy on showing you where in a ruby file structure to implement your code, week 3 hardly offers any guidance on where or how to implement your Rails structure. The broad stroke videos from week 3 kind of give you an idea as to what each piece of code is doing if your working from a template, but the assignment feels obfuscated when trying to build it from scratch.A major issue also comes from a third party website they require for completion of the assignment (and that requires separate registration to use). During several periods, over multiple sessions of the course, the third party site went down and was unavailable for as long as 48 hours at a time; during which it was impossible to properly run or debug the assignment due to its requirement.What the assignment is asking for isn't even terribly difficult when you do understand what is required, and the code is rather simple and minimal to implement. But you end up having to figure out a lot of that either off site (in which case you are not learning from the course) or by modifying a copy paste of some of the templates/scaffolding from the course GitHub content, in which case you don't get a good reinforcement of the material.In the end I wound up getting a certificate, feeling like I passed despite the course rather than because of it. There is some good foundation for a course in here, but it just falls apart in the third week and lacks any real depth.",2
4089,I have not been satisfied with the theoretical content,2

97389,"The course was great, however I think it should be more video content.",2
23727,"The course is essentially a self-help guide focusing on the idea that cooking real food promotes health. This is certainly a message that many people need to hear.Unfortunately, the advice concerning what to eat is less sound. Let me illustrate this with a historical counterexample.Around 75 years ago, a Canadian dentist visited my home country of Switzerland, where he examined the health and diet of a population in a secluded mountain valley. He found them to be of exceptional health. Their diet?breakfast: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheeselunch: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheesedinner: rye sourdough bread, butter, cheese and potatoes, along with some vegetables in the warmer half of the year, and small amounts of meat on SundaysContrary to four fundamental recommendations in the course, these people ate a lot of saturated fat (butter) and animal protein (cheese), but few vegetables and had hardly any variation in their diet.They did prepare their own food, grown or pastured locally, in very mineral-rich soil, which imparted their butter and cheese with very high amounts of fat-soluble vitamins A, D and K2. Perhaps animal foods are not as unhealthy as the course suggests, and food (and soil) quality is paramount.Instead of taking this course, watch Maya Adam's TEDx talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-gyIkA-crM) and browse the recommendations of the Weston A. Price Foundation (http://www.westonaprice.org/) to learn what to cook, in particular their Healthy4Life dietary guidelines (http://www.westonaprice.org/wp-content/uploads/Healthy4LifeEnglish.pdf). If you still need a self-help guide to actually start cooking your own food then by all means, take this course. It'll only take you about an hour.",2
17178,"Incredibly frustrated by the peer grading system. I've been able to work on the course at relatively fast pace and have now completed all of the lectures, readings, quizzes and test but can't go on to the next course because not enough people have submitted the homework for me to grade. I understand the advantage of being able to ""learn from others"" but it doesn't outweigh the disadvantage of not being able to work at one's own pace .",2

93777,"You don't really learn what you need from lectures. While I agree part of the experience is having to search and figure things out yourself, this goes beyond what I would expect.

2565,"This course may be misleading aspiring data analysts and scientists: it may give the false impression that, with the tools learned here, you will be able to analyze your data by yourself. In fact, you would be completely missing on large chapters of statistics and, as a result, you would often end up drawing wrong conclusions and believe you did a great job. For example, what is the point of giving you a single 10-minutes video on how to do regression in Tableau if you don't even know regression (which is AT LEAST a one-term course in graduate school, and only after several other prior basic stats courses)? BEWARE: get a much larger background in statistics before applying anything you learn here in real life. Some minimal stats knowledge should be recommended as a pre-requisite for this course, or else you end up doing like those monkeys using a statistical software without really understanding what they are doing and drawing conclusions with blissful ignorance. The problem is: some of your audience will know and will notice, more often than you might think and you will end up looking like an idiot.Sorry to be negative here, but I think I owe you, my co-student, at least a warning: do learn more stats elsewhere!! ... good luck.",2
25240,"This course was full of issues related to the installation and use of Pentaho Pivot 4J and Data Integration. The professor's presence is resolving these issues was practically nonexistent. Coursera needs to do a much better job at insuring that their professors are offering a quality course and living up to the expectations of the students. In the case of this course and the professor, they failed miserably. In addition, it is practically impossible to get support from Coursera when an issue exists and in most cases when contact is made, the assistance is minimal. It is a shame as the platform is nicely designed and the course topics are very interesting. If you are considering taking this course, be forewarned that the majority of the support of problems/issues come from the community, not the Professor or Coursera. In addition, you are required to grade the assignments of your fellow students. This is not done by the professor.",2

I think maybe this is one of the classes that doesn't work well in this format.",2

For most of the topics I simply went to KhanAcademy and got it easily there and I was asking myself, why a topic was made so complicated. I have the same issue with the next course. I highly recommend to start visual explanations of what you want to achieve instead of throwing formulars at people and confuse them. IN KhanAcademy e.g. they do exactly this and you got the point and if you got the point, the formular wasn't such a big thing anymore.",2

The biggest problem is that this way the grader won't be able to give you meaningful feedback / hint of where you might be wrong. A grader that only tells you ""your answer is incorrect"" does little to help you learn from mistakes.3.

For free, the course may be still useful as early introduction to strategy but as paid course, refrain for the time being.My earlier review below.-----Delivery of the course - presentation, videos, sequencing and articles for each video are very well organized and executed. Referring cases studies is good as well.However, the material seems simplified and is very much a basic course and not intermediate or advanced course.Additionally, the quizzes are very simple and have ample room to increase the difficulty level in order to make the course more challenging.",2

104517,"I enrolled in this course hoping to find a balanced perspective about historical foundations for religions and other philosophies. It did include a good amount of interesting material around different systems, but there were a couple of key things that made me lose interest in the course at around week 6 out of 11.First, I felt that the instructor talks about how he wants people to learn to think for themselves, yet I also felt that he himself preaches. Much of the evidence in his lectures is delivered as an anecdote, which might appeal to some (e.g. I could see that happening to me) and probably made the course more entertaining, but didn't do it for me. I felt that the Wade reading, in contrast, was balanced, cited other sources, and pulled in a variety of perspectives, but when I listened to the lectures, I felt that Professor Ogilvie had a tendency to state points and expect people to believe them.Second, on a related note -- this course was not shaped for the online medium. I understand that it's cheaper and easier for universities to just use recordings of live lectures, but that meant that the lectures contained quite a bit of anecdotal rambling (e.g. going off on a tangent on how you should never take charge of somebody else's soul). Another, smaller beef I have with the presentation of the course is that when he had students who were raised under different religions come up and speak their beliefs, it took a long time to demonstrate a fairly simple idea -- despite people ascribing to the same ""label,"" the same religion, they can have in fact been taught very different things. In a live university class, having students speak can work because the evidence is being presented by ""one of you"" (""you"" being the students), and has the added benefit of building community in the class. But in an online class, I didn't feel that kinship at all.I'll make a disclaimer that much of this review is about how I personally felt about the course, and about how it wasn't right for me. Some of what I didn't like, others may like. But overall, despite being initially interested in the topic and why people believe what they do, I didn't feel that the material was delivered in a way that captured my continued interest.",2

Lectures are a bit hard to follow, not because of the complexity of the topic, but because of some controversial and outdated data, and the speaking and presentation style of the lecturer.Assignments contain too many trivial questions, but also some mistakes which makes some questions impossible to answer correctly, based on the lectures, or at all.No staff engagement or feedback on the forums, which is especially problematic regarding to aforementioned mistakes.The title and description of the course don't inform students that it is completely US-centric, and mostly concentrating on petroleum/oil.

Not very deep and not always structured, but rather focused on the technology principles instead of the data principles.I think that this specialisation suffers the same problem most data science/mining/analytics courses suffer: it ignores the non-technical starting point: scientific or business relevance. How does one organise data, get to know completely new data, understand possible value? i.e. how to start a data science project if all there is is unorganised data and the wish to do 'something' with it.",2

This woman chatters on way to fast and if you use the slower speed setting on the videos, it crashes every time. I am not happy that I wasted money on this class. It offers nothing to prepare you to actually do any real life HTML coding. I highly recommend either purchasing a book to learn on your own or take a class elsewhere.

Also as this is a rather math-intensive subject, a more comprehensive review of the algebraic tools and skills required would be helpful. Lastly, there were many mistakes with grammar and spelling in the written portions. I know English isn't everyone's first language, but if we are paying for these educational materials then it doesn't look very professional for there to be glaring errors repeatedly throughout the material.

On one hand it goes way beyond the simplicity of the lenght of the course, assume a mindset that extends well beyond this course, and on the other hand after doing the quizzes some times and observing the considered right and wrong answers, some of them - to say the least, are highly ambiguous and express a personal point of view of the instructor in what is right or wrong (what by itself is not very reasonable), and lack ultimately in objectivity regarding the materials covered. I am not by any means saying that the quizzes are hard or simple, I am saying that they lack objectivity and go beyond the scope of the materials and try to put the student on a state of trying to guess what the instructor's opinion is regarding the question at hand. In some cases the 'best' answer chosen is absurd. Highly questionable this approach.

28137,"This course does go over some of the basics of graphic design, but I expected it to be a lot more rigorous. The assignments are incredibly simple, and I think that there should be no optional assignments in the class. The reason I'm taking this class is because I have a hard time motivating myself to learn on my own, so I need something that will really push me. I only spent about an hour a week completing this course, and I believe that you can't learn something by only spending an hour a week on it. Also what's the point of having mentors if they don't engage with you? I know I could have contacted them if I had a question, but I didn't because it was so easy. I wouldn't mind getting feedback from a professional graphic designer though if they're available. Also seeing how many students misinterpret the assignments, it makes me nervous that they are the ones grading mine.",2

19136,"Main issues I encountered in the course:- many videos end with a suggestion to ""refer to the suggested materials for more information"". Which are these materials, and where can they be found?- the slides could use some diagrams here and there, as the constant text screens are monotonous and make understanding harder in some cases- the course does not settle on a balance between breadth and depth of information. Some aspects are presented at a very high level, yet using very specialised terminology and concepts. For instance, context switching when describing the disadvantages of microkernels, or pre-emptively scheduled systems - I have a CS background and had no problem with these aspects, but I am aware I am highly subjective. It's a case of ""chicken and egg"", where if you understand the low level concepts you probably don't need the course, and if you don't understand them you also can't understand the high level concepts.- At the end of the Week 3 videos describing the three OSs, it is said ""In order to know the details on how to write a program and run applications in Riot/Contiki/TinyOS, please come back to our lectures who have more detailed videos.""Which lectures are these, and where can they be found?- the only practical exercises in the course (Week 4) are only vaguely related to the course's targets-----All this being said, it is an ok introduction to the embedded OS world, if you bring your own CS and OS background knowledge.",2
65290,"I hate to write a negative review when the designers of the course have clearly put a lot of love and attention to detail into making it. But...The quality of the code is bad. The quality of the testing code is even worse. This endeavours to teach some horrible practices. That's a shame, because the editing quality of the videos is excellent, the use of git and rspec is likewise commendable.Even worse, it's not entirely clear who the target audience is. A lot of the topics introduced are aimed at complete novices, yet not explained in a way novices might understand. The course needs some serious rethinking and refactoring.",2

90156,"So I'll start with the positives. The material was appropriate and interesting and well presented. CJ Taylor is an enthusiastic lecturer and the material was presented in an enjoyable easy to understand way and having finished the course, I definitely want to learn more about computational motion planning.The problems I have with this course though are numerous. This is the second part of the Robotics Specialization and compared to the first part, this course was very weak. There was very little lecture material and the course felt thin - as if it were 2 weeks of material stretched over 4. There were many instances where the lectures could have gone in to much more detail and just didn't, I appreciate that you can't cover everything in lectures, but would it have killed you to provide or at least point to some good additional reading resources?The assessments were the worst part. The quizzes barely tested what I had learnt and could mostly be solved by common sense. What I find shocking is that there were so few questions with few multiple choice answer that you could easily brute-force these quizzes if you really wanted to. Compare this to the Aerial Robotics course where the quizzes took time and forced me to think and understand what was discussed in lecture.The programming assignments were shockingly bad. They were hard for completely the wrong reasons. I spent most of my time on them not coding the solution, but trying to figure out what was actually wanted and fixing bugs that were in the provided code that we WEREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO EDIT. The autograder would never tell you why you were wrong, just ""I'm sorry, your solution didn't pass all of our test cases."" This meant that finding the solution was based on guesswork rather than considered thought. This was made even worse by the fact that some simulations took a long time to run which made iterating guesses very slow - and doing this on a time limit is just pointlessly stressful.One of the assignments had the solution already in the source code as the instructors had forgotten to take it out.The final assignment wouldn't even run out of the box without fixing bugs in the provided code. This would have taken seconds to check had the person who wrote it bothered to check their work beforehand.Thing is, the tasks provided in principle weren't that hard, they were actually kind of too easy. Dijkstra's algorithm isn't that difficult to implement from scratch, and yet all that was asked of us was to implement a small 10 line for-loop. That said, I appreciate that as a software engineer, I might find this sort of thing much easier than most, but even so I don't feel as though the programming assignments helped me learn anything.Overall, regardless of how interesting the material was, this course was very shoddily put together. I appreciate this is the first time the course has been run, but this really felt phoned in and unacceptable. I paid money for this course and the quality of it is notably worse than most free MOOCs I have taken. I feel ripped off and I sincerely hope that the next section is better otherwise I doubt I will bother to continue until the end. I thought Penn University was better than this.",2

I believe not enough foundation was given to make people use the Galaxy tools consciously. The final project was ridiculously far more difficult than what had been covered in the class.

Emulation is slow and almost un-usuable with plenty of boilerplate code required to do simple events. Xcode by comparison is very smooth and easy to use.

3291,"Angular JS is a crucial component of all of the internet. Hardly a website exists without it and it's clear that Angular will go places. However, this course fails on a few crucial levels. As such, my review might look scathing and I'll detail why in a minute, but I want you to know that this course is quite possibly invaluable when it comes to web development. Besides, the fixes that would need to be made on the instructor's side are minor, but when working without those fixes, things get infuriatingly frustrating rather quickly.There are errors in the code supplied by the instructor that need to be pointed out by students, scripts sometimes don't work, explanations are sub-par when explaining things such as $scope. There are parts that are seemingly there to pad out the lessons such as Task Runners. Sometimes, doing things exactly the way shown in the video with additional fixes by both the professor and students, it still doesn't work. Some exercises are an hour long for something that won't be quizzed in the end.Understanding that this review was made about a new course that covers something rapidly changing and not persistent, I still did learn a lot of valuable things and I would recommend this course to everyone involved in web development. However, be prepared to question your own sanity, your skills, the software you use, software in general and just despair at times.

For starters, the weekly problem designs aren't very good. Some problem statements are ambiguous and not very clear unless you read more than one time or take a closer look at the examples. Often, the input format/arguments are designed to take redundant info. Some problem even has more than one possible correct outputs, which is just confusing for learning purpose.In terms of lecture videos, it's good that there are some classic algorithm problems being demonstrated in the video, however the linkage between how to express a problem in mathematical languages is poorly explained. For example, in the lecture of edit distance, the realization of the matrix was not well explained at all. I personally appreciate a lot of the thorough proving steps introduced in the lectures, however I personally think the proofs are often not well explained to the audience (I also understand that it's more difficult to explain proving steps). Considering the large variety of audience, I would recommend the instructors separate the comprehensive more in-depth knowledge into optional videos, in this way the audiences could decide if they want to spend time in optional videos or not based on their own needs, meanwhile the instructors could spend a little bit more time to explain the difficult concepts better.

Either way I felt like I taught myself all of this material using web resources and got absolutely nothing for what I paid for.,2
90843,"A tough score, which I have mixed feelings about as there was good stuff in here too. The course material is interesting and moves at a robust pace and I do think they have made an effort despite the fact that much of it appears lifted from one PhD student's dissertation. Realistically I would not recommend this course if you don't have a STEM Bachelor's degree and you will likely find it painful if you have been away from your degree more than three years. None of this is bad, although the material would have benefitted by being spread out by perhaps two more weeks as realistically people who have been in the workplace a long time may need more time, and have less time per week with family commitments. Unfortunately there are a number of areas that need work:1 - Inconsistencies and errors in the material. Certain unexplained suffixes in equations and worse, changes in the suffixes without indication that they changed or what they are. I don't feel that this was particularly widespread but it did result in some loss of confidence in the course and time being wasted ""interpreting""2 - Tests throughout the course that often provide the relatively limited feedback of ""correct well done"" or worse I'm sorry to say, the relatively useless feedback ""sorry that is not correct"", without ANY explanation of why it was correct or more importantly what an incorrect answer should have been and why. I can understand that this will hopefully drive students should do more research, but if they hit a wall, realistically they're going to keep iterating on the answers until you pass and learn nothing because of the time pressure to complete by the end of the week. I wonder if there is a better mechanism that can be used here3 - TA Support - The lack of TA support coupled with some concern about a history of errors led the students to believe that there was an error in week 3. For 10 days students went back and forth debating which one of the two equations that were supposedly doing the same thing but with missing terms were correct. NOT ONCE did a TA wake up and step in. In the end one of the students flagged the video as ""inappropriate"" to wake the UPenn organization up. The TA then stepped in and said (I paraphrase) ""oh, we just dropped those terms because they're not so important, but we didn't mention that..."" If you are not going to adequately support the students, the material had better be bullet-proof and show some linear thinking4 - The last exam. Keep in mind if you do this course, you had better be comfortable with calculus, linear algebra, vector math/mechanics and it would be helpful to have a head start in Matlab. That said, the last question in the last exam, was an order of magnitude more challenging than everything else set and almost felt like a ""shake out"" question. I passed the course and had a good understanding of the material, but I suspect that the folks that did, made it through that last question in multiple random fashions. The material itself is relatively academic and the trajectory topic was definitely so. Unfortunately the one example (jerk trajectory) provided appears to have left a lot of students feeling very unsupported based on feedback I saw, and would probably benefit from having an example more fully worked through. As for the final exam, it would be highly desirable for UPenn to provide insight into how they would have solved the last part of the last question as my concern is that there is a whole contingent of people who did this course who didn't come away with as good a grounding on trajectories as they may believe they have",2

Some of the concepts are excessively focused in Asia... Also the LG interview videos seem excessivelly of 'free' publicity. It should be avoided.Overall - in my opinion, to be relevant in the online you have to upscale your game. Yonsei presents very short courses, as it can be seen in the specialization emerging technologies. Hope you can change your approach in the future or I don't think your courses will have traction.

Instructors saw no value in presenting elements of course that would help learners complete the assignments; rather you are sent off to teach yourself about uncovered techniques needed to complete the assignments. From some of the posts from previous students on GitHub, they resorted to deriving the answer from another means (Excel?) and simply providing the answer as a constant value, in order to receive credit for particular questions. Not exactly sterling knowledge transfer, from instructor to student! This course should be presented as a challenge course to people that have already learned Python Pandas from some other venue. (BTW, Pandas documentation is also dreadful, as of this writing.) This is definitely not the way to learn Python for Data Science if you are a busy professional software engineer.

Its not maintained by anyone, and the people taking this course had to find ways to overcome QSTK bugs to be able to complete their assignments.And lastly: the exercises. There are none.

3523,"This course covers the basic ground about approximation algorithms and would be very valuable for a practitioner, but seems designed for people who already know the materials and is more theoretical than applied.Lectures are very abstract --with a description of the problem and a formal description of the solution--, there are few examples with step-by-step tracing of algorithms --that is how the algorithm actually works to solve the problem--, and a significant amount of expertise is assumed --so much so, that you wouldn't need this course. For example, there are questions about ""approximation ratio"", but it is not explained. This seems like something that is inherent to approximation algorithms, but is only asked in the exams/project, and is not even mentioned in the lectures. Similar issues abound around the course.",2
104010,"The professors did no prepared the classes. They make so many mistakes in the video lectures and they also laughts in the middle of the course and they send a non-professional feeling to the students. The content of the course is very good, but the proffesors could really do better.",2

72553,"There are two frustrations with this iteration of the series. One: the quiz questions are often opaquely worded. Instead of being tested on the material just learned, it seemed like the objective was to learn to decode test questions.2 and the most glaring omission, was that when students are asked to provide functions, only some are provided with a follow up test to ensure the function is working properly. If the output is syntactically correct but provides incorrect output then you're moving forward blindly after that. Then add the quiz questions from problem One above, and you're just wasting your time after that and building up frustration. Validating your code as you move along seems like a pretty rudimentary process to impart to students and when the teachers don't practice it themselves, there are bound to be problems.I like the intent of the course, and considering my outsider background to computer science, the mathematics etc, I did learn a fair bit. Not enough to justify the increasing frustration I was feeling toward the end of this course. I have no intention of taking any more at this point, not from these authors.",2

I really just need the [meat of the video] part. These videos are 5-10 minutes long each. They are very short and therefore I do not need an introduction/closeout for each individual one. The Module Overview and Module Recap videos are sufficient to serve that purpose.Overall, I learned the basics and will probably take the next GIS course because I like the Coursera framework, but I think this particular course could be much more condensed.",2

The third project (fuzzing and symbolic execution) was a joke: ""Type this and tell us what you see."" My advice is if you are a novice, take the free course first to see if you can complete it.

I tried pinpointing exactly what the problem was and I came up with following:There is too much talking and not enough going on visually. I know you have a person in front of a white screen, and a few visual effects such as floating words and diagrams. It is just not working for me. I have a hard time remembering what you said. I can pause and go back again which is always nice but the info still doesn't stick. This especially true for the LCA part, which I don't even think is a difficult concept to grasp.I think the best courses I have seen online is not particularly rehearsed and it is usually just a guy, with a pen, running you through some examples to illustrate the working principles. Afterwards they do an everyday life example. I find that these courses always help me a lot.I am sorry about the 2 stars but I hope you see it as a room for improvement. It is probably a first time for you guys to use an online platform as a media so it will take a couple of iterations to get it right.I did like when you illustrated Isc and Voc in terms and abbreviations. More stuff like that, possibly also with an electrical diagram etc and som flow analogy.If I can propose anything it would be to organize it a bit more like Michigan Universitys Python learning series.

But for the later part of swirl, it's confusing sometimes. However, I learnt much more from swirl rather than from the instructor. I can't understand what he is talking about but you have to make it clear thru using swirl. He said the swirl is an optional part but he does not realized what he shows is much worse than swirl.

Just recently, Dato (the company that owns graphlab) was purchased by Apple, and you can no longer buy a commercial licence to the software. Despite this, users cannot use Graphlab for commercial purposes, therefore rendering the software completely impractical for professionals.

Stating, again as if it were a given, that deficit spending is naturally the right answer to a crisis. When politicians and their pawns develop a course should we be surprised that the answer is always more government intervention?

I lost momentum and even motivation and as a result am now behind with the assignments and quizzes.",2

The programming assignment is VERY VERY unsatisfying. It's not explained clearly; there's no helpful instruction; and it is very confusing. You need to spend hours and hours just UNDERSTANDING what you need to do. And some algorithms are not even told in the course and you need to implement them! I know this could be a good exercise but I would hope it at least provide some useful resources.Generally, I am very disappointed. I feel like I'm spending hours and hours but learning nothing.

I won't knock Mr. Caffo like some of the others here have because at the end of the day everyone learns differently. What works for some might not work for others and unfortunately his style did not suit my learning requirements.My rating is purely based on the content which I think can be simplified by giving more visual examples. I am rating this after taking the 'Regression Models' course and in that course it is MUCH easier because he gives ""real time"" and visual examples of what, eg Residuals, mean or represent. Just that alone made a huge difference and it then helps me focus on how to write the R code rather than trying to understand the math. Hope this helps!",2

While it's clear that a lot of time was spent filming and creating the course material, I still would not recommend this course. Both the presentation itself and the in-video quizzes are unbelievably obnoxious. The presenter emphasizes every other word and talks in a very unnatural manner that makes it very tiring to listen to, and the in-video quizzes are far too basic and take up too much time. Sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activities, which are badly designed and just frustrating. Overall, I recommend waiting for a better course.",2

But for a course that is supposed to teach you how to analyze data in excel, there are actually very few lectures that actually show you how to do anything in excel. So much time is spent on how to calculate stuff by hand, without even mentioning how it translates to excel. Also the lectures have a lot of errors that were not corrected in a professional way. Just a random slide put in as an afterthought. The lectures got a bit disorganized towards the end, like the professor was in a rush and then forgot to relate everything to actual business analysis. The final project was especially difficult as not much was explained - I had to read the forums to figure out what I was actually supposed to do.",2

I also missed the bio in biostatistics. A title like ""Mathematical Statistical theory boot camp"" would be better suited. I believe having a set of cases that get reused in some form over all lectures would be very beneficial for -at lease mine- understanding the topics.

They both agree that the result is weird but then continue to explain that this is how Swift works.

18853,I was interested in this course but as it stands it is more like marketing hype than a proper course. For one thing it tries to cover far too much material in 4 weeks. Within the limited scope of the beta test I started the node red stuff. It looks easy but the lecturer didn't make it clear what it was for anyway.A much more thorough introduction should have been given to everything.The lectures on the Rasberry Pi were a joke. In order to do the course within 4 weeks I would have had to order a Rasberry Pi before getting to these lectures. A clear guide to course prerequisites and the Rasberry Pi and Sensehat must be provided.Neither of the tutors seem very happy about their job. This is a small point and not a show stopper.Overall - don't issue this course without major revisions (perhaps a new course team).,2

I assume the pacing is to allow for people that may have difficulty with learning the language. I'm not certain that it has the depth necessary for those that may have difficulty though. If you are at all serious about learning to program, don't limit yourself to this course, or it's pacing. I would suggest researching every subject covered, to get a bit more depth, and moving through it at a brisk pace. If you take the pace suggested in the course, you're likely to have bought a new computer before you can program anything extremely useful.",2

And no suggested reading materials at all either. Also the quiz are not very well designed either. For example, some quiz are much more simpler than the course material, which makes it not helpful at all to understand the course material itself.

94661,"This course covers very interesting topics, but there are some serious shortcomings in the lectures. Too much information is just omitted or taken for granted. Some of the lecturers are rather inexperienced. Reading or reciting mathematical expressions in a monotonous voice without actually pointing to the visual representation of the lecture material makes it very difficult to follow. Better care should also be taken with the quizzes - if one looks at the comments or questions posted by some learners, it is clear that we simply don't understand the question, or a question is answered correctly in essence , but the quizz expected more (or less) precision without stating so . Finally for some reason the support from Technical Advisors was also lacking in the specific session that I did, contributing to my frustration and rather negative experience of what could be a very good course",2

Bugs in the new interface and quizzes weren't really addressed. Couldn't even get an official response about the apparent removal of Distinction-level now (which I'd been working to get in all specialization courses and now seems no longer an option). Still interesting content. As a ""free"" course, it's still really valuable. As one of the people that paid for this and all others in this specialization, this is the one I felt didn't return as much value to justify the payment with no ""official"" course staff seeming to be involved this round.",2

70775,"The lectures were too wordy and the lecturers tripped over their words too often (which wouldn't have made it so difficult to listen if the lectures hadn't been so wordy!). There was too much focus on high-level details of the course project and too little attention paid to technical details. This rendered the lectures simplistic, boring, and sometimes a waste of time. This felt like an introductory level course, made more difficult through poor teaching.Also, the slick web interface was slightly difficult to navigate in comparison to other Coursera courses.",2

32715,"This course tries to cover the many aspects around the games industry. But the coverage in each of the subject is not deep enough to be useful. For example, the instructor talks about project management, public speaking, how to write a resume etc. The instructor starts by talking about why they are useful, and then followed by one to two 10-15 minutes long video lectures. Each of these could worth a full Coursera course and I am sure the other courses have better coverage than in this course.The quiz questions are not well thought and do not stimulate thinking at all. Some of the ""correct"" answers are personal opinions but you have to choose them in order to pass the quiz.The third peer grading assessment asks students to post a video either to pitch himself/herself or to pitch the game the student makes. However, the specialization up to this point does not equip student with the skills beyond the basics.

Good idea, but, with a few exceptions, less than average execution.",2
48703,"I think it is a decent course to understand how the peer review process work. However, it does not really help to write a paper. I think some ideas are not applied to every field. In particular, telling students to look for the board of editors in a journal and adapt your results and how you express things accordingly, it is in my opinion a bit unethical. Moreover, I was expecting that the course will be taught by a professor, but instead, it is done by a group of PhDs, some of them in their first year of research. If they intend to target a PhD audience, this is clearly a drawback as some of them might know the same as you do. Finally, as some people already pointed out, the quality of the English of some of the instructor is not good. In particular, there are a couple of them that you can't barely understand. It would have been more useful if the full course is taught by the 2 of them that can actually speak good.",2

The slides contain a lot of paper references that seem to be of high quality (that's the reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not just 1)... but the course itself is bad: it covers many algorithms, but so superficially that you learn nothing; and there are not enough programming assignments to really allow you to get any intuition on the concepts.I would love to see this be turned into a 5-course, 30-week specialization in itself (and the professor sure looks like he has the knowledge to fill these 30 weeks)... but as a single course over 4 weeks, it's not good.",2

I've lost weight with a lower calorie diet and exercise, so, yes, it can work, but it is very difficult. I've kept it off easily for two years with a high fat/low carb eating plan. I've changed my exercise to mostly Pilates when my weight stabilized and I enjoy it enough to stay with it. knowing how difficult it is to stick to a low fat/high carb diet - which causes me to struggle with cravings, even when I am eating unprocessed organic seasonal local food - I hate to see a low fat diet recommended to people struggling with losing weight.

The extra star goes for stressing the importance of accessibility.To sum up: decoration largely outweighs structure.",2
61588,"Not up to my expectations. Compared to the previous modules in this specialisation, the lectures are dry, the presenter is not focused and slides are sometimes mixed up. The reading material is great and a definite plus is that it is free.

I went through all 4 weeks in 1 week, the whole course is mostly about downloading different tools and signing up for accounts.What I didn't like is that the teachers seem to be really concerned about their reputation and workload. Its repeated several times that you shouldn't email the teachers with questions and that online questions should be of a certain standard, its understandable but its a bit patronizing. I think teachers should be available for questions, even if its only through the forum (which they are) Its understandable that there are a lot of students so direct emails might overwhelm but that's just part of the job, we pay for the course, we should also get support when its not working for us.Overall I wouldn't advise taking this course if you aren't taking it as part of the specialization.",2

That said I have serious concerns about the quality of execution for Part II of the course, which was much inferior to part I of the course.In general, the lectures themselves were up to the quality of part I and are well done. In many cases, the practice quizzes were less helpful. Including one sequence where each quiz extended the previous one but if you there was no way to learn from your errors, especially an error in the first quiz.For the peer graded assignments, there was one answer field for multiple questions, rather than one per question. Worse, the answers often required equations and LaTex math was not available. The only solution was to put the answers in a document on a cloud drive like Google Drive and paste a link in. Finally, for the peer review you could just mark questions correct or wrong with no way to provide private feedback on what was lacking in a response. Furthermore, doing the peer review was purely optional and the results were not actually scored. (Part 1 was similar, but it was possible to upload the document to Coursera directly and peer review was a required part of the course, resulting in a grade.) Either there are serious limitations with this iteration of the Coursera platform or the course authors did not understand how to properly implement this.Finally, in the session I took their was no active Teaching Assistance presence. There were no responses to student questions nor concerns that were raised about typos and possible errors in the quizzes and problem assignments.

Neither am I excited about starting the lesson each week because there is no real world problem/or data set I'm continuously practicing from. The lessons are essentially a reference guide and not a useful approach for teaching. If I wanted a reference guide, I'd just pick up one of the various handbooks/books on the markets that list R codes and their functions. A better way to teach/present this course is by infusing actual, real world examples or cases throughout the lessons instead of just listing a function and talking through its corresponding activity/response. Ideally, the real world example would be introduced in the first lesson in Week 1 and that data set would be used throughout the course(s) to apply and practice newly introduced functions. Teaching from this perspective would likely make the concepts much easier to grasp and importantly, RETAIN. The lessons, as they are currently presented, encourage rote memorization and rob the students of actually applying the concepts/code taught.Also, I love the idea of this specialization. However, I think the professors need to work more closely with online instructional designers to make the entire series more palatable for online learning. It very much feels as if they have adapted a traditional course on their own without the help of professionals who are skilled at designing online courses. If the aforementioned is the case, the professor(s) should be commended for their efforts, but there is definitely more work to be done to make this an engaging course I'd recommend.PS - I am taking notes and I have some experience with STATA so this type of coding/anaylsis is not unfamiliar to me.

He jumps through parts that could have otherwise given valuable information and experience like creating the deck class. Nope, he just has it all premade for you. The course stresses ""You'll need to program a lot to gain experience, so you'll be doing it a lot of programming in this course."" - but I'm not, there's no programming at all.

There is so much detail and explanation about the statistics and concepts behind how it works, but there is hardly ever an actual lesson on the code used or needed to implement the algorithms. When trying to fumble my way through the code, I found, on several occasions, the code in the self-directed lessons to be incomplete (I'm referring to pieces of code that were obviously meant to be there, but were missing), causing hours and hours of anguish and turmoil. I feel like there should be a lot more time spent on the actual coding and learning how to implement it within the code (similar to the 1st course), rather than spending an exuberant amount of time going through derivations and no time on actual coding and how to implement it within the programming language.If you are a software designer/engineer or programmer, then you should be fine as long as you pay attention to the very long lessons and derivations and can fix the broken code that you are given. There are other mistakes within the quizzes as well, which make them near impossible to pass. For example, it is unclear which model you need to use to calculate in order to get the correct square foot. On other occasions, the question actually specifies to use the model from (3), whereas it actually wants you to use the model from (4) instead to get the correct answer.

19266,This is a very unevenly paced and constructed course - not at all delivered to the standard of the previous Coursera courses I have followed. Some lectures are clear and guide the learner step by step - and then others suddenly assume a level of knowledge and sophistication that is at a significantly higher level and includes concepts that have either not been introduced or have been dealt with in minimal detail. It also ends up focusing more on music analysis than music theory - while there is a relationship between these 2 approaches I did not embark on this course to become an analyst - as a practising musician I wanted to understand more of the concepts behind what I do and hear. Very disappointed - I will now look elsewhere to satisfy my learning.,2

96466,"I concur with others of a similar opinion on this course:Assignment instructions/criteria differ from the grading rubric criteria. Assignments mostly copy and paste. Referring people to the Bootstrap docs as reference defeats the purpose of an instructor. Many of the assignments required you to do things against best practices, like inserting inline styles to make your element look like the instructor's screenshot of his page.The last week's content seemed to be a slapdash mix of bits and pieces, and trying to inform people about Node modules via solving a quadratic equation seemed really strange. How about an example from the real world, like even an e-commerce application? (In the comments on this, the instructor said there wasn't time in this course to explain Node modules, but that he provided a ""clearer"" example in the Node.js course. Hunh? Why wouldn't you do a simpler example in the drive-by assignment?)Instructor consistently mispronounced words that are CENTRAL to the field, which just seemed weird and made me question his credibility. This might sound petty, but kuh-rooze-zel for the word Carousel? It would be like a fashion designer mis pronouncing tulle as tull-ee or bias as bye-ez.Just not impressed.

The presenters appear to approach the subject half-heartedly, and focus their energies on disproving the possibility without sufficiently examining it.b) A lot of the review questions focus on remembering facts rather than on understanding the causes and effects. For example, what is the relevance of being able to remember that job losses at the height of the crisis were of the order of 880k a month or 200k a month??c) It is obvious to anyone with even trivial financial expertise that the financial system today is weaker than it was before the crisis. The too big to fail are bigger today (by a large margin) and interest rates are too low (remember the search for yield was the motivation for the creation of the exotic securities which blew up the system).

There is a long road to go after you finish this course, which makes me think the certificate is almost pointless and worthless.It also uses things that are generally considered a bad practice (like using DOM event attributes in the HTML). It is okay to present that to the students, but you should also mention that while they are there, it is usually not recommended to use them and explain what would be the recommended practice.I have taken courses from other sites like Codeschools, Codecademy and Treehouse and left Coursera for later because I believed that getting a certificate would require me to have some expertise, but so far I feel kind of disappointed with the Full Stack package.I am hoping it will get better with the next modules.",2

As an auditor, I am no longer able to participate in the assignments or quizzes in this class. Without the ability to do the assignments and receive peer feedback, it seems pointless to continue the class. Furthermore, there was a problem with the practice exercises... You need to download an app to do the practice, which I did several times, but the lessons or assignments never worked. I sent notes to coursera about this with no reply. The low rating is primarily based on the fact that I could not do the practice assignments and that coursera took away the ability to complete assignments and take quizes.",2

That's everything but good style (for software as well as for learning).- Code snippets can't be tested individually.

93137,"I am a very frustrated learner trying to write a constructive review here. I studied the course full time to get a certificate to put in my profile. R programming is considered nearly essential skill, if not fundamental, to data analysis. So I had high hopes going into this course.Lecture videos: I cannot begin to tell you how many times I fell asleep watching the video lectures. This course is for you if you like listening to someone talking through pages and pages of copy/paste text from a command prompt. I, on the other hand, prefer learning by doing. Sadly, all the doing is clumped into the assignments (more on them later). Also, Dr. Peng makes gross burping/drooling noises in the video from time to time. I apologize if that sounded rude, but try listening to the lectures with headphones and you'll say the same. Video editing for pre-recorded videos is not rocket science.Assignments: These were the biggest frustration throughout the course. Imagine you want to learn to play the piano (and you play a little guitar now) and you go to the piano class. Your piano teacher talks your ears off with music theory for several hours and then hangs you out to dry in front of an audience in a concert hall. You protest ""But I have no clue of how to PLAY"", but your teacher says ""All the piano greats learned by fiddling around with a ""hacker"" mentality"". You ask ""Why did I pay $50 to hack on my own?""Off-lecture help: If you take the course for the same reason I did, then thank your favorite god for the moderators in the discussion forums (mentors). 1 out of the 2 stars I give belongs solely to them and the fantastic work they do. The stickied posts in the forums offer a bit of help with the assignments (not enough, but still something). And they are also active in answering questions. The other star in my review goes to ""Swirl"". You will learn way more by doing the swirl exercises than watching the lectures by a long way.In conclusion, I finished the course with nothing more than a rudimentary understanding of R despite the fine grades. Very little thought seems to have been put into the lectures. I would recommend this only if you want to show this certificate to someone. Otherwise, stay away!",2

The quality of the course material is really poor and disappointing. I would like to believe that on a UI course people would have come up with a better and more intuitive set-up.

I think they need to carefully look at the questions with the most incorrect answers and ask themselves if they've made a mistake. Also, this might be the first time they've tried making a peer-reviewed project part of the course, but they did a poor job. They made it a homework assignment for week 2, but didn't make it clear that it wasn't due until the end of the course, even though Coursera sends you emails saying it's due soon. This caused a great deal of confusion. Some of the required readings also had broken links. It's odd nobody on their end checked those the week the material was taught.

The content was good, if a little outdated (hence the two stars vs only one), but the course design and delivery were lacking.The videos were excruciating for visual learners (or really any non-auditory learners). The video for Week 2, Lesson 2, for example, had a single static image on the screen for eleven minutes. Words were added to the image during that time, but all in all there were 26 words of text on the slide. Really?!? ELEVEN MINUTES. 26 WORDS. Give me a transcript or make it an audio file. Don't keep me chained to my laptop watching a static image for ELEVEN MINUTES!The instructor droned and was clearly reading from a script. She did not even use the video to highlight key terms or spotlight key references. Whenever she mentioned a reference I wanted to look at, I had to either hope it was on the course reference page (many of them weren't there) or try to figure out how to spell the author's name based on her pronunciation of it. It was just really, really hard to get through.The tests were also poorly designed. What states do x y or z. Who cares? I don't live in those states. Which online school has this policy? Again who cares? Maybe a question about why states/schools have different approaches or how outcomes differ between states/schools, but memorizing a laundry list of which state or school has which policies and practices is useless and did not advance the learning objectives in any way.",2

All assignments build upon the code written in the exercises in all previous weeks, so there is no way to know if you are starting off with correct code. The lecture videos contain a lot of code examples, but the various key notions covered are not explained and the assumption seems to be you will look those up in the API.

The style class, the plot class and the setting class all had detailed, concrete teachings, whereas these lectures were too airy. Most of them consisted of authors chatting with each other. The assignments required real craft however, and it would have been helpful to LEARN those skills in the modules.For example, one assignment asked us to describe a character in a setting, while they were not actually there - say a divorced nurse in a hospital. Not once in the lectures were we ever taught HOW to do this. We watched a series of author fireside chats, and then people bumbled through the assignment. I really wanted Amy Bloom to just walk over to the board and draw a character and say ""this is a woman, she's divorced, she's middle class, she tends to get very angry when things don't go her way"" or whatever,and then draw out a list of how her internal states might manifest in the world around her - she throws things, she's disorganized, she writes mean notes in the patient charts.I wanted her to teach. She seems to think we already know how to do things like imply a characters state of mind through action. I mean, for a beginning writer, its helpful to just make a list of details about a character - where they're from, what they like or don't like, what sort of flaws they might have and so on. We did barely any of this. It was assumed we knew the basics of characterization, but most students did not!some of the other students frustration and confusion came out in the peer review, which was a bad sign.",2

About extra options we did not talk at all.Additionally, after all these easy lectures and quizzes we were left with the final assignment that was super-hard. The vidoes only prepared for 1/3 of the workflow asked for, and for the rest one was left alone with a tool that was suboptimally introduced. Furthermore, the galaxy instance was crashing regularly, making the convenient batch tool impossible to use.While I liked the idea of grading each other, it was too much work, as everybody got different answers, because of too hard questions.

Another course, “learning how to learn”, has the best tests in that regard;- the modules are too long. When you do this in addition to working, it becomes a chore;- the assignments: instructions are tedious & confusing. As for the assignment themselves, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was a test subject with data being gathered in the back. Not what I signed up (and paid) for.So it’s a pity and I do regret having had to stop attending this online class. I was attracted to the topic, I enjoyed the personality of the host, but all the above made it a chore.",2

The teachers, while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields, fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon. I'm not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren't used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them. As someone who was taking this class without that advantage, I was quickly lost among all the jargon, to the point where I just had to stop.

33262,"The caliber of questions in the quizzes is quite advanced. I would be fine with that, as the challenge of writing correct html5 is a good challenge. However much of these questions were not covered in the lectures or the required and optional reading. Learning the correct html tag syntax is not intuitive--one has to be shown examples. If no examples have been covered, how can a quiz-taker be expected to create the proper tags? This strikes me as bad pedagogy.In order to answer the questions and prepare the requested page of html tags, it became necessary for a beginner such as me to research elsewhere in order to answer the questions. In that case, I began wondering why I was taking this course, rather than just reviewing the many free html5 explanations on the Internet.Further the very general response to the submitted page of html gives me no help when I am simply told something isn't right and I should review the lessons--again. I expected better feedback.I found this course to be fascinating from the lecture point of view, but ""abusive"" in terms of quiz expectations.

Then the large middle section covers very basic info about the types of energy production (coal, oil, NG, renewables) in the world -- low in factual content considering the time spent on each topic. The final section about political considerations was very basic and only focused on the US.

From class one I struggled trying to understand what was going on. This may be because instead of just using a typical ide like eclipse or netbeans, they use bluejay, which works different than the rest of ides. In addition, programs used in the course are pretty confusing (If you know 0 Java). I learned most of the basic concepts (classes, methods) for whole week 1 from a single 15 minute video-course from youtube without all the struggling. As I mentioned this only applies if you are a total newbie, if you already know some Java I think you'll be fine.",3

52346,"The lectures are much better than Module 1 BUT still too thin on information required to complete the final assignment. I probably spent 30 hours in all completing the assignment because I had to spend so much time looking up material that was not covered in the lectures. A lot of my time got wasted since it is very difficult to figure out the syntax/structure of the language from the very skimpy lectures &/or the very technical Apple documentation.Also, not ONCE did the instructors participate or respond to the forum discussion so it was not a surprise that the forum was barely used at all.I am stuck with soldiering on with the next 2 modules since I pre-paid for the specialisation but really I am very disappointed with what I am getting for a paid course.",3

87010,it's hard to understand,3
21238,The course covers very limited subset of plots and mostly oriented to R-specific technical routines rather than overall approaches. Case-study example is helpful and contrary to the most comments I do appreciate the final course project: this how most problems are stated in real life. If you would like to cover more fundamental concepts behind exploratory analysis I would recommend other sources.,3

I had one response from another student which did not actually address the issue of my question and I had several views. And it wasn't as if there were a lot of questions posted. One course mentor could have easily answered all of them.,3
17653,Very basic course!,3
72275,"Too reliant on materials directly collected by professor, too little context of larger artistic community.",3
24811,"This course is a bit repetitive and provides only a few real life examples. As well as this, the evaluation of this course is based on the result of a single quiz of 15 questions, which is not enough to prove any knowledge at all. I think it should focus on a more practice oriented course in order to master the price optimization process and see how it fluctuates in real life examples.However, this course gives great insights and useful concepts that are of huge importance to the application of the revenue management activities.",3
9181,"The teacher is very passionate; therefore I enjoyed the topics that were taught very differently than when I took AP Calculus AB in high school. The answer input sections for the tests and quizzes were rather frustrating because I had to type very specific keys on the keyboard just to input a constant or a polynomial. And one typo caused me to fail some assignments. Also the decimal approximations were very specific to the point where if I didn't type an extra number in the tenths, hundredths, or thousandths place then I would get the answer wrong even if I did the problem correctly.",3

67162,Excellent content and overview of the field. Appreciated the links to journal papers as extensions to the lecture notes. Course is let down somewhat by lecture notes that skim the surface too much to really be useful and outright errors in quizzes and assignments that will hinder completion unless you read through every forum post to find the missing information. (Quiz 13 was the worst offender).,3
15471,This course offers valuable information on the different aspects of Construction Project Managment. The only critic I have is that the instructions/grading rubric for the assignments are terribly vague. The assignment starts with a simple example in the videos which the student can reasonably replicate and create their own version. The problem starts when you begin the peer-assignment grading and realize the grading points are painfully specific. Now you have to go back and re-do your homework assignment after you learned what was really expected from the student. This wouldn't be an issue except that your second draft may not get graded if all of the students are done grading. Plus it's annoying to have to re-do work that you could have done right the first time but the guidelines were unclear.,3
21610,There were some technical challenges that made this course not as fun. The content was good. If you make the assignments easier to submit (for example: provide a box to write a statement as opposed to uploading one) it will remove frustration and increase enjoyment.,3
14494,"Good introduction, but the professor could have been more descriptive about how to use git/github. These are new concepts for people so it may be difficult to grasp right away.",3
10365,Good concise introduction for the topic.,3
77680,Exercise need to be more heavy,3

13848,I need to have a class. I really think this course could hel me a lot.,3
106775,"While the information is certainly good, and I enjoyed listening to David Hill, it is too basic for me. I was looking for something that wasn't an introductory course, but I took it thinking the peer reviews would be worth it. I had a difficult time downloading peer writing to review, and I never got any feedback on my assignment. I also went to the forums for discussion, but there wasn't anyone adding new information. It seems like a ghost class without any real live students. Since it is not interactive in any way, I am just spinning my wheels. Not worth the effort.",3

86010,"Good, but very very basic",3
47800,"There were some interesting insights coinciding with my own experience of learning (I have learnt 8 languages by myself). Particularly the part about chunking was a really good one. On the other hand, Week 4 focusing on how to pass a test in my opinion jumbled the previous material up - passing a test doesn't mean knowledge, it means ability to pass a test. Half of the questions used in the final Quiz shows that this course itself has tried not to develop chunks they were recommending but to make students memorize the content of the video without checking whether or not the content was actually understood and ""chunked"" into real knowledge.So, a better name for this course would be ""Learning how to learn academically"". As for me, I appreciate non-academical knowledge. Kids master their native language without getting the ability to teach it - and this is the true knowledge even though in the farewell video prof. Sejnowski equalized the ability to teach to the knowledge.",3

40228,"Good information and assignment design, but please just have someone on your team go through this.

42158,Not many new concepts. Mostly common sense.,3

99832,Too basic and too easy but helpful content,3
13567,"Course content is ok, but some lectors are really boring in explaining mathematical details.Tasks are pretty easy, and this is from algorithmic perspective, because from programming there are almost nothing to do.And overall it feels that there are not so much info as for 5 weeks course. If it would cost lest, than it would be ok. But for 80$ I've expected more.",3
43088,"Interesting learning course. You need to stick to follow the videos (may seem a tedious by moment). Overall, a good average course.",3

7745,"It is a really interesting course, it refers to the general public, with smart tips and quick recipies. Also, for those who know nothing about the sience part of lipids, carbohydrates and trace elements, in generall, it constitutes a very informative ''package'' for everyone. There is no specialaization in this kind of coures us I expected, because I am a food technologist, I kwnow most of the parts, but still it is really helpfull and interestin! Verry good job!",3
4888,"Thanks for providing lots of interesting materials! As for me, i would prefer having more advanced tests and tasks as the given ones did not really help me remember the materials. I would also appreciate having some additional materials on the brain areas in this course, since this area was completely new to me.",3

18395,lectures should be more detailed!,3
66572,"I have taken many courses on Coursera now, and I've enjoyed and learned a lot from most of them, but I have to admit I was disappointed with this one, despite having a deep interest in modern art and art theory. Here are some of my criticisms:1. The course is aimed at teachers and art educators, which was not made at all clear on the course info page, apart from a single reference to the 'pedagogical framework'. If I'd understood this, I may well not have enrolled.2. I found the course very basic, with no consideration of art theory beyond a level appropriate for classroom discussion. This is in contrast to many other Coursera courses, which have been pitched at graduate level or above. I don't really feel like I learned anything on this course.3. The video lectures are very short and uninformative, but the weekly reading list is very long and much more time consuming that the actual tuition. I would have preferred a better balance between tutorials and reading.4. The weekly quizzes were very short (six questions, where other courses typically have 20 to 30 questions per module), and and questions focus almost entirely on the pedagogical set texts, with very little attention paid to the art history or the works discussed in the tutorials. If you are not going to be tested on the material, what is the point of all that required reading?5. The final peer-assessed assignment is lacking in instructions or guidance. For example, you are required to upload images of 3 or 4 artworks and discuss them. It is in fact impossible to upload more than a single image, but there are no instructions on what to do about this. People found various workarounds - uploading pdfs or Word documents, or zipped folders of images, but really, there should be some official guidance on this.6. Comments made when assessing other students' work are not anonymous - this is unique in my Coursera experience, where anonymous marking is the norm, and knowing how fractious people can get when they are disappointed with their grade, I am not at all happy about having my name made available to them.Overall, the only reason I persisted with this course is that I wanted to get a certificate with MoMA written on it. Too bad I couldn't have actually learned something as well.",3
76761,"I struggled with some of the instruction as I couldn't get the exercises/quizes to work right; even with multiple views of the videos, posting questions, etc.",3
76611,Maybe too easy.,3
51665,"I enjoyed the course but I think that it could have been more informative and a bit less repetitive. It would have been nice to have had some concrete examples of balanced Nordic meals. The course failed to mention dairy products. This said, I really think that the concept of the New Nordic Diet is great and should be adapted and adopted in other parts of the world!",3
46877,The course is too some extent useful It indeed spreads useful techniques and concepts in learning. One thing I do not like is the testing questions. Some of these questions are poorly designed. Using intuition or commonsense is already enough to solve them.,3
40759,"I thought all of the information was great but at times the course was just very bland especially in terms of presentation. Also, the title is somewhat misleading and the presumptions that the course creators make about its students assume I am a business guy sitting in an office or a part of some team which makes the activities that you HAVE to do in order to pass the course a bit harder to complete. This is good because if what the activity desn't really apply to your situation it makes good practice to imagine a situation - not soo imaginative the task is incredibly easy - and apply what you've learned. However, as I've said, if what you're being asked to do is harder to apply than the activity in many ways isn't all that practical. I prefer Cumulative tests as well because they assess everything you've learned and whether you've retained the information or not.",3

51972,"A great course and fully packed with interesting information about different methodologies thought time. Wouldn't give it 5 stars because most part during the video lectures are just silly and although I know the professor is trying his best to convey an idea, it seems like there are moments it just drifts away from the point. Also, the ""angel x devil"" debates are equally silly, opposite to the following overview video which is excellent. I'd recommend everybody to take this course but I certainly wouldn't do it again and neither dowload the videos for future reference.",3
18804,Tutorials was not matching skills to achieve assignments given. Due to that was involved many ad-hoc works which may not the best practice.,3

To me that was drawing the idea that the Almighty Creator does not exist. But that is silly, given that only now we humans are just coming a tiny bit close to understanding how our brain works and how all the intricacies of the universe function - when He had that all figured out and established from the beginning. My point is, give credit where it's due. T",3

I recoomend to remove this topic and focus more on solidifying foundations so that students can be more prepared for moving through the whole Algorithm Courses.

I looked at the other assignments, but I thought they only asked me to put to paper things I was already thinking about anyway. Given the untimely and low quality of peer feedback on the first assignment, I didn't feel like I'd learn anything from completing and submitting any assignments. I refuse to buy a webcam for Coursera (I have a phone with that capability but the Coursera app doesn't support it for identity verification), so I can't get a certification anyway. I thought the content was interesting, but too basic to pay for. The major value I see in the certification path is extensive feedback on the capstone project, as I thought peer feedback came too late and wasn't extensive enough to be valuable. I do think the instructor does a good job of presenting the content",3

63544,"I once had a boyfriend who said my mind was like an encyclopedia that had come free from its binding. To some extent that's true, and it makes me, I think, fun to drink with. I think the Prof of this course would be super fun to drink with, too. I can only imagine the directions the conversation would careen, how many diversions and reversions and tangents we would go on. In terms of instruction, though, I find it rather exhausting. First we're talking about Ottoman reforms, then a diversion into Goethe (or some other dour Teutonic thinker) then a tangent into- but we'll cover that in another video so in 1924, but if you read L'etranger.... I've taken to listening to the lectures while doing something else, and then parsing the transcripts, trying to tease out some sort of linear narrative for my notes and it's just so effortful and time-consuming.",3

94446,"I am no used to this educational system so I find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools. I find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts. Another benefit of proof will be to have a more rigorous framework for variable names in the explanations.

67437,"I rather liked the material and its delivery. Another thing I liked very much was students' commitment and achievements as exposed in the peer-reviewed assignments. What I disliked was abundance of personal-computer slang in the language of the professor, jamming all the peer-reviewed assignments into only two weeks and the incident with broken APA style.Despite my criticisms mentioned, I am grateful to the professor, HSE and Coursera staff, and my classmates for the opportunity and experience!",3
74976,Course has mindblowing but it needs update,3
18868,"Good lectures and content but the guidance for the assignments are not particularly clear. At times, it feels like grading parameters and questions are just loosely coupled.On a more personal level, I found that the deadline at the end of the same week of the lectures does not allow for a lot of time to ponder and digest the information. I've tried a few other MOOCs; they all granted students the week after the lecture to prepare for the assignment.",3

17040,"Even though the theoretical part was well put together, case study questions were too vague and should have been better thought out. This part of the specialization did not meet my expectation.",3
9382,"The professor spends LOTS of time doing really, really simple work -- over-explaining things, to be honest, in such a way that makes them more confusing. Then he does not explain much more complex issues throughout the course. Very frustrating, even as someone who has taken calculus before and is just taking this as a ""refresher.""",3
57406,"I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what's going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept.The real reason I'm rating it 3/5, though, is that the mathematical notation is all over the place. You will find a matrix product such as A*B' only to go on and implement A'*B. This is SO confusing.I would still recommend this course, but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors.",3
19482,"This course is good, but I think should it be split in two parts because of density of material presented.",3
40619,Adequate information to grasp on. Learn something useful. But the videos are a bit boring that sometimes I have a hard time to carry on. Hope to share more interesting video examples and reading materials. Good effort but spice up the video a bit with salient stuff instead of pure talking and notes would be good.,3
90275,Too much theory and projects didn't related with real life problems.,3
106713,"I don't like that the 3 and 4 star reviews are missing!Coursera seems to sometimes remove reviews with lower numbers of starts.I thought that this course was going to be mostly on the brain, but it wasn't at all.... just a small section.If your main interest is in vision then it might be different, but for me being interested only in how vision relates to the brain, there was very little useful information in this course for me.",3
93553,the assignments have nothing to do with the presented material. Would have liked some practice of the concepts presented in the lectures as opposed to learning new things just to be able to do the assignment,3
90416,"I had difficultly with the two assignments, not because they were difficult but because the instructions were not clear. From reviewing other's assignments, it did not appear to be just me.",3

40512,"I worked really hard on this course, but was stymied by a couple of quizzes. If I could not answer one question correctly, it meant I could not answer two or three of the next questions, meaning that I could not pass quiz. With no recourse, I was prevented from passing although my overall percentage of points earned was passing. I would still like to pass, as I feel that I really earned the certificate. I would really like a chance to speak to someone who can help me resolve my questions. My other problem was using one of the models, which I never could master, despite reading the help sites and trying two or more times.",3
5933,"I agree with some of the reviews here. It's fantastic at the beginning of the course. Towards the end, unfortunately the professor's accent is heavy and sometimes difficult to understand. The subtitles don't help either because they were auto-generated. My brain had to take extra cognitive workload to decipher what was actually said before trying to understand the materials on the slides and everything else. I also didn't like the way index 0 and 1 is mixed in different lectures. Why shouldn't we stay consistent in pseudocode using index starting with either 0 or 1? The slides are confusing regarding this matter especially when you translate algorithms into code.Nonetheless, I liked the assignments overall. The course's instructors included some of very interesting problems and indeed helped understand the lessons better. I also liked the course structure and the carefully prepared slides.",3
11846,"It was pretty intuitive and easy to follow the first couple of weeks, but then the assumed knowledge of beta and gamma distributions and their frequentist usage, stood in the way of me fully grasping the Bayesian part of it.

98858,"Great contents as the rest of the courses in the specialization. I'm afraid I need to be a little bit critical with this one though:1) The contents are really jammed into 4 weeks - The last week's contents are actually some kind of miscellany between mongoose, https, authentication and BaaS2) Not a single quiz or self-evaluation of sorts along the course - To be completely fair, the exercises shown along the way might make up for it. Still, I think it's important to spread some quizes around so as to make absorb the concepts more effectively3) The quality of the presentations is somewhat lower than other courses. There's even a video towards the end of the course where a Linkedin notification springs up on top, which even makes the presenter pause for a few seconds.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this course and definitely appreciate the effort put into it - Given the newly introduced Coursera fees, I'd expect much more quality in place to make it 70 buck-worth, though",3

28318,"For what it was, it was a decent course. For some reason I thought it would be a little more advanced. This was a very basic class. Wording of the last assignment limited creativity as it was hard to tell if you had to limit your pictures to 2 shapes,(as in one circle and one square), or 2 shapes(as in as many circles as needed and as many triangles as you needed, but don't add any squares). Reviewing these assignments, because they were so basic, made it hard to offer much in the way of constructive criticism.",3
75910,"Very easy material, with a bit boring assignments. With not much more effort more material could be covered.",3

79877,Real live scenarios of running a project would add a great deal to the course.,3
1046,"The material was good, but I did notice a couple of lectures and in-course questions presented out of order. What really turned me off, however were quizzes. In weekly quizzes the first answer was always the right answer. In the final quiz most of the questions had the first answer as the right answer. Since randomizing the answers is so obvious and easy, I am really at a loss why the quizzes would be presented in this way.",3

101317,"Too fundamental, too easy. No depth in math",3
35188,It would have been good to have more assignments using more complex songs and asking for students to try soloing.,3
88912,"I almost gave this two stars, but the content of the course is excellent, and I didn't want to take away from that. To start off, for an introductory class, this covers a large amount and variety of material. It might be better served to break it up into even smaller sections over the course of something like ten weeks or even twelve instead of cramming it all into seven weeks.The lectures are enjoyable, but often they consist of nothing but the professor speaking. There are so many new terms, definitions, and ideas being introduced that it would help if these lectures also included slides or graphs with some of these ideas being broken down, as you would have in a regular class on a projector or on a chalkboard.Frequently, the practice quizzes are just the same questions from the video lectures repeated over again, and offer very little prep for the actual quizzes, which are painfully pedantic for a non-credit course. Every section has a different style of quiz, which is hard to prepare for. I am someone who usually tests well and have been struggling with most of these, even when I read all of the handouts and take notes.So, if this same course could be broken up over a slightly longer time and the quizzes could be more uniform, the lectures contained some slides, the course would be a brilliant introduction to philosophy overall. It's got all of the meat there, the presentation just makes it tough to digest.",3
35655,"In my humble opinion it is necessary to review some points in this module:1) Video Content: Making more dynamic, switch between explanations and slides in full screen. Only explanations, it is very tiring to attend the classes. The video would be ideal as shown in week 4 of this Mooc: How the hotel shouldnt work with Expedia? or video: How to hotel shouldnt work with Booking.com?2) Analysis requested: In the first week the requested analysis was of a very high level, it required knowledge of financial analysis and hotel area. In my case, I felt much difficulty because I do not have any knowledge in the hotel industry. And analyzing the exercise, I realized it was necessary to have knowledge of financial ratios of profitability and a certain familiarity in the hotel industry. I left a comment on the discussion board stating that I was not feeling safe to do the exercise. However, there was no demonstration by the teachers of the course.In short, I was not feeling prepared, let alone analyze colleagues. The first time, did not get the minimum score. The second time, with the longest time, I could better perform the exercise. But rather it was the result of review of financial ratios and other other accessories. I realized that those who examined me in the first and second time, had little or no idea about financial analysis. And another point that struck me was that one of the people who fell for me to analyze, was all in white and the person apologized for failing to do. With nothing to analyze, I did not think fair to give a low rating, so I preferred not to analyze. If the person left blank, something needs to be revised.When mounting a course, you have to take into consideration that there are different levels of students: beginner, intermediate and advanced in the subject matter.The first week was not to have been given is analysis. It could have been the third or fourth week of this Mooc, so it would have time for a further deepening of the matter addressed.3) Amount of content: Adding the video, quiz and analysis, are about 30 content. It is very tiring and little time for such content. Could decrease the amount of video and quiz, relocating to another week course or Mooc.4) Feedback: Teachers need to leave a contact way (facebook, twitter, etc.) and be active in Coursera forum or leave a wizard to ask questions when needed.5) Notes: He missed the weight of the notes. I found a little confusing the allocation of notes.6) Curriculum: Missed curriculum (biography) of teachers. No contact information.7) Books: Missed suggestions of books in the hotel industry.Anyway, these are only observed points in order to contribute to development of course. Thanks for listening.",3
88447,"I found the course good overall, but the tempo was a bit slow for me and I thought that the online lectures could have been provided in a shorter period of time. Ideal for a beginner, but I had some previous experience with PFA.",3
29695,"The course provides a solid structure on which to build academic essays. The content of the videos is generally good and seems appropriately targeted but the sample essays are disappointingly trivial (and not terribly well written). They seem more suited to young High School students rather than would-be college level writers.The big issue is in the peer assessment process which forms the centre of the practical experience in the course. There is a tremendous time lag apparent between essays being submitted and being reviewed. Mine took between 3 and 4 weeks to get through the process. This is obviously an issue for Coursera to address as it relates to the platform design rather than the course team but it is nevertheless frustrating.There is a big disconnect between the standards the instructors seem to expect and the assignments submitted. The vast majority of students clearly do not have English as a first language and for many writing an academic essay is really some way ahead of their current position. Perhaps more disturbing is that most of the (apparently) native English speakers seem not to have taken any notice of either the lectures or the peer grading rubrics.Despite the shortcomings in the peer review process the material is well presented and offers a strong framework around which students can build good effective essays.Once again, the lack of a forum in this course makes life unnecessarily difficult and frustrating and for me pushes my rating down from a low 4 to 3 stars.",3
37892,"The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html/css and fully dives into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with JavaScript, I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering. Still if you are a total noob, you should take the course anyway, as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object-oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer.Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues, grading, and discussion board input, I gave the course a 3 out of 5. My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though.",3
19354,"Although overall the course is interesting, it is clear that it has not been designed for MOOC format. A clear structure for learning lacks, and some of the lectures seem to be more about the people talking about their own work than trying to convey general concepts in the drug discovery field. I think the course would benefit from more structure in the way the lessons are presented, starting with a more general outline of what a good drug is etcetera. However, there are some interesting concepts I can take along in my further studies, but I am slightly disappointed.",3
47385,"Good instruction, but it was a bit too basic - many of these concepts are common sense to most people in college or beyond.",3
52098,OK but was expecting better. I was missing the structure a little bit.,3

I have programming experience and feel I would have found it quite a challenge otherwise, but not prohibitively so. Chris is great at explaining things in an accessible manner, and I'm very much looking forward to going into more detail in the rest of the specialisation. I would have enjoyed a little more focus on statistics etc and a little less on the mechanics of the library, but understand why it had to be approached this way.",3
14579,Good overview. But it is confusing for the first class when you have no idea about the topic.,3

25493,"I found that the momentum build in the first course of the ""Game Design and Development"" specialization was lost when going into Principles of Game Design. In my opinion the course became too focused on the theory, where it could have combined the learnings of ""Introduction to Game Development"" with the principles of game design in a 50/50 ish combination.However, if your sole purpose is the theory of games and game design, and you do attend the course in relation to the specialization, then by all means, it's a decent course.",3
12714,The comparaison between Chinese and Western Culture was really useful. It was a nice overview but it would also have been interesting to get information (at least some ints) about the long and fascinating Chinese History. More historical context would be appreciated.,3

495,"The instructor does an excellent job, but realistically there is no way to be proficient enough in a 3D software program after a week or two to earn a certificate. The certificate is worthless in my opinion. I liked the class but it seemed more like intro vs. a class of any proficiency required.",3
9281,Great teaching methodology - although the test are a bit too centered on number crunching and not reasoning. (a lot of number crunching and no room for little numerical mistake although reasoning is good),3
100592,really interesting but also really difficult to finish the assignment. it would have been great to get a sample assignment just to get an idea of how it could look like,3
52784,A fascinating course but delivered in a rather wooden fashion by the lecturer. Good illustrations. I would have liked to have known more of the overall value (if any) of the Jewish contribution in the context of Chinese economic development i.e. was it of any overall importance- did it make any difference? Is it still relevant?,3
43500,The course is good enough to learn a few concepts about techniques to improve the learning process. Four hours per week is all you will need to finish it with good grades. Great work!,3

18014,Highly recommended .Wonderful course and good content but a bit slow ..Could have been faster.,3
61823,The last week assignment is easier and no strict rules to achieve. The majority will do the minimum to finish the course.It would be more efficient to push all students to make hard plots in Matplotlib (interactive + animation) with strict rules.This is not a level of an intermediate course!,3
104259,"The course is ok, but it doesn't give any certificate of completition for free users (something that many other course do give).",3
94024,On later parts the videos are poorly edited and less interactive. In one place practice quiz has wrong answer marked as right. (Whether it's a situational question or behavioral).,3
69491,Pretty good course for beginners.,3
8871,"The modules had a lot of aspects and covered each one in detail. However, it would have been helpful to have some hands-on exercises like writing an executive summary, evaluating a resume, writing an elevator pitch etc so that people learn from each other.

35819,"The Course itself is fun. The videos are enjoyable. The subject matter is great. However the quizzes are way to hard. They ask to many questions with multiple answers and the online student is expected to know so much more materials that is probably taught in the actual class, and does not have access to. For that it becomes frustrating. Especially that the material is not easy to digest.",3
1647,"Interesting enough, good start to the specialization but not the most content for a standalone course.",3
93661,I wanted to love this course so bad but unfortunately I couldn't. There was a great distance from what was taught in the lectures and what was asked for you to do in the assignments... and It's not a matter of knowing how to program. I know Ruby and Python but R is a very peculiar language itself. Perhaps they should invest more on gradual exercises like the one they advised to do on github or some easy statistical exercises... Now I don't know if I should take the next module or if I should look for something out of here where I can learn R. I see potential on this course.,3
25070,It is cool. but it does not give any certificate of completion at the end as other courses do.,3

69722,"An easy course, though I disliked the lack of Chinese characters (only pinyin - the transcription) and lack of grammar rules. I recommend it only for beginners who know nothing of Chinese.",3
80204,"A bit confusing in term of structure. We jumped from some sections of the project life cycle to others missing some others. It gave a good general picture of what project management is about. But I'm not quite sure which is the order I should follow when dealing with a project. However I have to say I didn't do the optional readings. At least not yet!Anyway, I think is an overall good course for not initiated people like me",3
81263,"The lectures and resources are good quality and offer a lot of information. However, the peer reviewed assignment needs revising.I submitted all the assignments early for the course, making sure to get in my peer reviewed assignment a week early to ensure that if I needed to, I could resubmit and have time for grading. I did not receive a grade on my assignment until after the deadline was passed. My assignment was mis-reviewed by my peers, clearly they did not read my paper, they just clicked randomly at the grading options. This caused me to fail by a few percentage points. I resubmitted my assignment that day, highlighting the content the graders missed. I still do not have a grade on this assignment and fear I will fail the class.The reason I bring this up in my review is that there is no contact information for the instructor. There is no process to dispute the grade. The assignment needs an overhaul if you expect people to take the assignment to pass the class.",3
8881,Very helpful tips for preparing a professional business document. Hoping the course could have more focused exercises to make sure learners actually master the skills.,3

106994,"The course addresses quite precisely and pragmatically every aspect regarding young athletes anatomical and physiological development. All the information provided in the lectures is research-based and Dr. Brooks states clearly when she is providing information which needs further investigation or clarification. The lenght of the lectures is short and these are very well organized by modules, facilitating the learning process. The information is almost always related to its application to young populations. While the topics covered by the course represent a fair amount of the information a coach should have, psychologycal and social aspects, which are quite important for training young athletes, are not convered in depth. The assessments lack effective feed-back to support the learning process, given that after taking the quizzes you will only know if your answer was right or wrong, missing any instruction about the course content itself, and the only peer-assessed piece misses a feed-back section which may help to improve future writing.",3
106554,"The lecturer's style doesn't go with the nature of a MOOC. By using his book as the notes for lectures, he doesn't give himself a chance to prioritize content so it's kept clear in the exposition. His favorite word is uh-um. In a classroom (face-to-face) situation, the lecturer is likely to see and react to listeners' look of confusion; in a studio he is just talking to himself. He repeats points -- this can be good if done smoothly but it's very confusing when the lecturer is inarticulate, like the present case. It's really too bad because he clearly has a lot of knowledge that could be used to popularize thinking about the unwritten constitution.",3
51089,Great subject and some very well presented videos. However there were several which were incomprehensible. Either because of the quality of the video or the very heavy accent of the speaker especially to a non-American viewer. One doesn't always want to read a transcript but to listen and concentrate. If all the videos had been of good listenable quality I would have given the course 5 stars,3
81662,a bit boring lectures,3
51698,"Better than the first, but it looks like each element was created in a single day. Some segments were repetitive and dragged on, though the instructor seemed both personable and knowledgeable. When the ONLY visual is the instructor, it gets hard to watch. An interesting model of both what to do and what not to do in creating your own online course.",3
84262,Nice job ! However some of the important points have been skipped and focus has been limited at times.The best part of the course were the lab assignments.Hope quizzes were better in standard.,3

There is also no option to re-take the final assignment, which was peer-graded and I believe I was not properly evaluated by my peers.",3
52348,"It was good but I would really appreciate it if MVC was tackled in more detail. Also, I wish there was a video about UICollectionView.

105106,"This course is very interesting, and everything is there should be known to start a business.But basically, it just says to respect everyone and everything. This course lacks some content. It repeats itself. It says the same things over and over again, just in different words.It's still a very good course, and it motivates you doing to do something with great values.",3
64541,"You have to pay to take the the tests. You might as well watch videos on YouTube or better yet get on Khan Academy. I did like the instructor. Even though he takes a while to warm up, he's really good at showing the big picture connections of why things happened.",3

14107,Pretty basic stuff.,3
99051,"I had initially started the course in order to gain insight more into the role of wind energy, the operations, the components and financing behind it. The course was a little heavy on actual mechanics and turbine output calculations. Would've enjoyed a more descriptive course with more emphasis on the financing and operational side as well as how the wind facilities fit into the grid. That said, it does provide a great basic overview of the concept and the mathematical side is still useful, particularly if interested in the engineering aspect.",3
9818,Historically the basic background have been discussed. Effort was to make it nationalistic and emotional.Significance of Menorah as a symbol is absolutely missing. All the emphasis was on the Arch but the Arch looses its very significance without the menorah. So this should be covered or shared properly. For example Questions like why 7 hands needs to be replied. Why 3 legs needs to be repliedWhy painting ? This learning was not supposed to be in it. Someone might or might not like painting as a concept to learn and the course title also gave no indication towards that.. Wrong to make it a mandatory part as an assignment.,3
49770,Theorical Course. Nice for those that want to understand some concepts of IoT,3
17391,"The course is awsome to get motivation and quite informative. However it teaches lot of practical concepts using Tableau which is a commercial software.Since these concepts entirely new to me. It take me a lot of time to understand videos and still I'm afraid I'll forget the things as soon as I leave it. I think some more practical activities should be introduce (on free platforms), to make knowledge more sustainable.",3

102096,"This course is an overview of SEO and doesn't go into a lot of detail of how SEO is actually implemented on the site. What it does do is offer a snapshot of the industry as a job outlook, discuss Google's algorithm impact on SEO practitioners, offers interviews with current SEO analysts and experts, and describes how content affects SEO. I recommend taking the more practical courses in the specialization to get skills needed unless you're an absolute beginner and have no clue what SEO is.",3
4309,inclination was more towards concept than excel,3
93241,This was actually pretty hard. I felt like the questions asked in the quiz were considerable above and beyond what was taught - and the amount of R itself taught felt like being thrown in the deep end.,3
100369,"It's alright, but could be much much better. I didn't feel engaged and half of the time I was just wishing the video would just end. The course itself highlighted some good ideas about saving time and prioritising, but the way it was presented just fell short for me.",3

97465,"Strategic implementation, something that people generally forget about after creating their ""marvellous"" strategies and then watch them fail. This course teaches us how not to make that mistake.The course was nicely organised, though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking. Rating on a 1-5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems, as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews. I hope it can be improved in the future!",3

15154,Good and basic understanding of terms.Can be made vast.,3
65947,"I liked this course for the wide range of movie excerpts which underscored a memory malfunction. The scenes were often emotional, quite surprising such a short moment could be so charged.However the main emphasis of this memory module was to explore malfunctioning memory, to the side of pathology. This was done professionally without a doubt. However this was not what I personally was looking for although one learns about dementia, alzheimer, etc, which is interesting as they will affect most of us in someway or another.",3
16078,Very basic course,3
4266,"Though at the start of the program indicates no prerequisite I would suggest that you be familiar with Algebra and Stats. Most videos are of Dr. Egger writing out algebraic equations and discussing them, the excel component of Mastering data in excel come via pre-made calculators as attachments that you for the most part need to figure out on your own.If you do not have a good comfort level with stats then you will require more time to spend on understanding the spreadsheet and it’s use.It would be fantastic if Dr Egger could go through the spreadsheets as a part of the video and show a couple examples, hopefully revisions down the road !It was challenging but not impossible, and if you do not challenge yourself how much are you really learning?Best of luck!",3

You can tell the instructor is trying to be upbeat but is very clearly reading off of ""cue cards"" so it's a little flat. For a free course you get a lot of information and it is very easy to get a 100 on every quiz.",3

69179,"as already explained in the preceding question, this MOOC is less well built and thus useful than the preceding one, partly due to the lack of time and efforts to present the tools, among which the score, the savoir relier protocol which stays on the whole quite theoretical, and some of the leadership models which are given too short a time for students to really make themselves an opinion about it.too many interventions from Oriane and references to what was certainly a nice show, would be good to balance testimonies from young students with more development coming from mature managersthis said, on the whole the MOOC stays a very interesting activity, and my last word will be to thank the team and wish for the SR community to become live, as I have found the conversation a very useful and surprising method.",3
48444,"The course was interesting but I think Coursera is not quite what it used to be. The courses are more expensive (This one was $100).

96345,"The topic is overall well covered.The material are not easy to go through and do not reference well key knowledge area, specifically: how to apply them.The exercises and the assignments could be largely improved: the targets and the guidance are not always clear. Adding up on the same files instead having one file per exercice / one learning key point does not help.",3

17727,Really basic course. Not needed for people you have already done data science specialization in coursera,3

48359,an online editor is not good,3
89071,I found the course a little hard to follow mainly because the video lectures would not load. I found I spent more time trying to get the course material working than actually absorbing it.I really liked the lectures once they were working though. Its a very nice introduction to a way of thinking and the examples used to argument the theories were very entertaining.,3
83090,Wrongly assumes that it'll be easier for students to jump from the conventional 'parallel' java paradigms and constructs to parallel streams.Not a good job on explaining why. It'll require from students some efforts to create the right picture in their minds.Exercises are great and partially make up for the above mentioned shortcomings.Some example code is very bad and goes against all the 'good' things being taught by Martin in the first course of the specialization.,3
3668,"There is not enough background information, no reading assignments. This makes the course less understandable. Also, the examples given not related to the stated assignment",3
90234,There should be more than just lectures. I find the overall content to be very exciting but at times the lectures get a little boring and monotonous maybe.,3
5204,some of the videos were outstanding and easy to understand. Need more handholding for understanding of concepts and review/explanation of the quiz results will reinforce learning further.,3

80246,"I watched the entire set of week one lectures, and sadly I do not think this is up to scratch with the rest of the material on Coursera. The presentation is not consistent: there are slides, web cam videos, animations, and it just feels like the course is a mish mash.

19027,"I've been to college, so I'm not the target audience for this course, but I was curious to see what would be covered and to learn more about colleges today. I felt the course covered mostly simplistic, obvious stuff and left out a lot that many students wonder about.One topic that was covered was the different activities of professors. I wished I'd known more about this when I started college. Of course I knew they did research, but I thought they were primarily there to teach. This is true at some colleges, but at others, the amount and quality of research can determine whether a professor gets to continue working there and reach tenure. So teaching may not be the first priority for some professors. Students may find that chunks of courses are devoted to a professor's research interests, which could enrich or derail the course. This could have been covered in more depth.Other things that could have been covered: why some courses are so large and the function of recitation sections and graduate teaching fellows for those and smaller courses; what a seminar is; the existence of course reviews that can help with selecting classes and professors; how to deal with not getting into a course you really need to take (wait lists, professorial overrides, etc.); when pre-requisite courses are really necessary and when they're just recommended; dropping courses; GRADES (how the college grading system works, what happens when you fail a course, academic probation, earning honors); campus codes of conduct (greater freedom as with class attendance; smoking and drinking rules, harassment policies) and disciplinary actions (disciplinary probation, expulsion); good campus activities for shy students.",3

ALSO, AFTER FEEDBACK THERE SHOULD BE A CORRECTION ASSIGNMENT OR A GROWTH OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE FEEDBACK AND MAKE YOUR PROJECT BETTER.",3

The basics are touched upon but I don't feel confident enough to start JavaScript coding on my own yet.

94207,Instructor rushes the course and does not explain much in the same level of details as respective quiz requires,3
90618,Course contents are very short and to the point. I thought weeks on Gaussian Model Learning and Robot Mapping were neat. But the other two weeks on Kalman filter and Particle Localization were little disappointing. They could have discussed both these topics properly by investing more time. Couple of Assignments are tough and there will be very little help to complete it but nevertheless it will keep you interested in the course.,3
94654,"The Course material and method of testing the understanding of the student needs to be improved. Despite the low quality of the quizzes, the course is very inspiring. The examples showed are very good and the lectures concentrated on teaching the underlying concept rather the Mathematics involved, which was refreshing.",3

However my lack of background with the topic discussed cause me to stop watching everything. Plus, I can't do the said assignment because I am a beginning on this topic. it seems this is not a course for me to rate based on content. However I will rate it in terms of the aesthetic, organization or structure of the slides .The organization of the content of the slides needs to be properly organized. Long paragraphs are a pain to read. Further when comparing, two concepts, it is easier to comprehend when they are in table form. For instance in FrontEnd JavaScript Framework Overview video, it is better in terms of organization and aesthetic to show library vs. framework in table form.Also, the volume of Introduction to AngularJS video is too loud. Though I can adjust it and lower the volume, but sudden high volume sound is discouraging when the next video has normal volume causing me to adjust it again.I was only able to watch few of the videos but they are good. Just a little improvement needed.",3
8367,Basic info covered.,3
82601,In general I like the course but I find it a bit boring. I wish it was organized in a more interactive way.,3

This was not clear to me when I joined. And although the content is thorough, it is dull and the assignments uninspiring.If you want to know more about grammar, good (be sure to bone up through, because she assumes a lot about what you might remember from high school and for those of us over 40 ... hmmm).If you want to feel inspired to write something of value and interest to yourself or others, not so good.Over all I would not recommend this course or series of courses. And would suggest seeking out a course that has some kind of proctor or supervisory help available.",3
95451,"Lectures were interesting and well put together, however the assignments and the knowledge required for the assignments were not covered in the lecture material. While I can appreciate that every course will require some elements of self-learning and exploration, this felt a step too far. My sense is that if you have some experience in the actual topics covered by the course, and are looking to verify your knowledge with a certificate, you will be fine. However if you are hoping to actually learn about the topics, you are going to have to work very hard. I'm hoping that the coverage of course material to assignment requirements is a lot better in the subsequent courses in this specialization.",3
3204,I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.,3
62121,"Given the great reviews I expected a lot more from this course. It does cover some new developments and provides good examples, but otherwise quite boring and standard fare.",3

It is incredibly slow, I really don't understand who might need a whole lecture to get the concept of functions or so.

29275,"Good information contained within the course which has sparked my interest in continuing to learn and build on my small amount of knowledge. Lower rating than I would usually give for a course because of the way the lectures are delivered. Having a lecturer standing in front of a brick wall, plugging his book and not really connecting with online students was not great. A couple of times during the lectures I dozed off and had to re-run them. If the plugging of own material was removed and the background and tone of voice were altered this could be a captivating and interesting course.",3

You will find yourself googling a lot of things as the videos cover certain aspects quite quickly, even some that are important to the assignments.If you have the time to research some of the concepts on your own I say go for it. However, if you don't have much time or you are a complete beginner I would maybe try something else.",3

106682,"Very informative and rewarding. Professor is very energetic and shows he is totally involved in the course. The major problem with this course is that, as complex as it is, coupled with the lack of access to the instructors to ask questions, perhaps the assistants could be more responsive and helpful with problems students are having problems with. It makes no sense to learn without knowing where one is making mistakes and how to correct them.",3

The lectures are too short and not informative enough to complete the assignments. Some videos don't show what the lecturer is talking about, maybe there is bug or something, but there is only some irrelevant picture. The due dates are inconsistent through different pages. Finally, the next day after the course ends I am not able to view my assignments and the grade for the last assignment, even though the authors sent an email that it would be possible.",3

29343,"Overall, I enjoyed this course, but it gave just a bit too much information on cognitive studies in other species, and it left me still wanting to learn more about dogs. The last 2 weeks were great! The professor was engaging and his work was very interesting, but he said ummm and ahhh so many times that it was a little distracting. The quizzes were good, but some of the questions were worded very oddly so I just couldn't get them right without several attempts. I didn't feel like he covered dog emotion at all. I thought there would be some discussion of facial expressions, the meaning of different tail wags, and the extent of dog emotion (for example, how they grieve and how long they grieve after a loss).",3

16719,"Pros: The course content covers a lot of relevant topics on Database Management. Things like Basic SQL queries, Database Normalization, Conceptual and Logical databases, and making ER diagrams are covered in the course.Cons: Prof Mannino is a bit robotic in his reading out of long sentences and the constant pace of talking. There is tons of repetition of sentences and words mere seconds after they were just spoken. The lectures seem to be a collection of bullet points.The assignments and the peer review structure is really a low point. There's no specific grading rubric - so points allocation is random and based on your peer's assessment. I had many instances where my right answers were marked as wrong. There is nothing you can do to correct it. Moreover, the questions are iterative and thus the same apparent error carries on and you get multiple wrong scores.Assignments need to be submitted in documents. Separate documents for each question !! At times, even a one-line answer needs to be in a separate document. Pictures of database diagrams need to be pasted in said documents. It was a bit frustrating to take screenshots all the time. Especially when you make a small correction, and have to take screenshots AGAIN, then paste it AGAIN, and upload AGAIN !!Summary: Take the course for it's content, and use the assignments as good practice. Don't take the grading seriously. Also, focus on the content rather than the delivery by the professor, and you will still be able to get some value out of the course (and the specialization by extension)",3
101690,"The course was interesting but it was clear that it is the first iteration. The course seems rushed, there are not very clear explanations on certain areas. Mostly, I had problems completing the assignments based on what I've learned during the lectures.The previous courses had difficult assignments and you had to think about how you wanted to do something, here the problem was using the Spark API and understanding things which weren't explained in the lectures. Also, not all the areas of the assignments were described.I am sure the course will become better in time.",3

The peer reviewed essays were good topics; but in one case definitely should have attached to the following week. The multiple choice tests, however, seemed to focus on trivia. Flawed; but still a really interesting course.",3
14688,"It's ok. After the first lesson, I should be able to provide a clear elevator pitch with a high level understanding of what I can expect to accomplish (4 or 5 steps) as a Data Scientist. Instead, there was one slide that touched on this quickly, somewhere in the middle. What are the problems, how do I solve them, give samples.",3
32682,"This course tries to address problems that might arise from game development. It's not an approach to the accounting problems, like finances, a game company may have, but mostly an approach to the bureaucratic problems of creating and publishing a game. It also provides knowledge about monetization pratices and publishing pratices, warning the future game developer how a publish may inadvertently ""throw a wrench in the works"" of game development.",3
14747,Course doesn't seem to be of much use. Was not much informative. Only some information is relevant.,3
7587,The course seems like it would benefit parents but does not do much for a nutrition health professional.,3
103629,A little too common sense.,3
23506,"Interesting, but not so much new things to know when you've already learned about healthy food. It's ok.It's quite hard because of the english language. :(",3
63031,This is an interesting course but I'm disappointed at the lack of female lecturers/interviews. I'm a female and would appreciate leadership/encouragement via role models from educators in this traditionally male-dominated field.,3
18828,"The course experience was a little bit weird. It's too easy for a dedicated programmer or IT person, but there are some obstacles to a person who are not familiar to the Javascript programming. (And maybe Python programming, too.) The main problem is too small community. I wrote some, but never got any answer. I think it's due to the charging policy of this lecture.",3
13314,Not a lot of practice problems and somewhat superficial information.,3
94008,"Good course.However the initial part ,that is recruiting hiring portion could have been conducted in a better manner.It felt as if the lecturer was reading out from a text book.",3
30992,"This course is helpful and I have learned quite a bit about punctuation and sentence structures.However, while things like tense are important, to be able to differentiate 12 tenses contributes relatively little to typical academic writing. Rather, I have had trouble with seemingly simple questions such as when to use past tense and when to use present tense in a literature review. But these aspects are probably the most useful when it comes to pracital writing. It would be helpful if these issues are addressed.Also, the use of articles is a common weakness for a lot of students (to ""the"" or not to ""the""). It is helpful to include this component too.",3
65227,"Compared to other courses I have completed on Coursera, this is one of the most confusing ones so far",3
66739,"Several errors on the correction of exercises, not so deep material about the statistical analysis.",3
52828,"Bare bones. Pros: mostly clear, Cons: it may require outside supplements to fully understand and complete the assignments.",3
39185,"Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization, it's a bit of a bait-and-switch. Prof Aarabi is an award-winning professor at U of Toronto, but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material. Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he's a terrible instructor. This class is the best of the three in the specialization because Mike Spears does a pretty good job with the sections he teaches.",3
82728,"Decent course, except in the last week it felt a bit stitched together from parts of a previous course and a new one. The jump in flow seemed abrupt and the relevance of some of the contents (regarding Future's) was not clear.",3
4640,"Good course, gently showing an introduction. Had the playspeed at 1.25x the entire time though, otherwise they talked too slow.",3
60484,"Too abstract, too expensive.",3
33665,"It was good but little bit too fast, and not obvious, i suppose it would be better it was over 6weeks for HTML5 things only.",3
396,I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week. I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description . Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.,3
47952,"Only few starting videos give new information and techniques, the rest 80% is quite useless. Course would be much better if it gives real tips and techniques rather than constant repetitions of the same information in different forms. If you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the videos.",3
90883,"I think there needs to be more association elaborated between the video lectures and the questions being asked during the lectures. It seems these questions are asked before the lecture itself tends to touch the point of it.Secondly, it was a bit difficult to associate the assignment write-ups to the lectures. Obviously they were relevant but this should be more clear in text and video.",3
21604,Pros:Good concepts. Peter Glanding is a very good teacher.Cons: Too short and concepts explained too quickly.,3
91003,This course was a challenge. Mostly because some core requirements of the assignments were not explained in the lectures. I spent more time searching google for information than I did the lecture videos because A. the lecture videos are not named or indexed in such a way as to make it easy to figure out which video to rewatch and B. in many cases the particular thing I was trying to do wasn't covered at all. It may be the instructors teaching style to get you to research yourself but I could have done that without paying for the course.,3
76161,"good content, but slow pace. tiny increments per week",3
13416,"Nice course, but the discussion forum are not the same as in the old format. I also think that the shiny videos from Rstudio are better than the instructional videos in this course.",3
105356,very little relationship between lectures and assignments. was expected more practices,3
83508,"It may be the purpose of the course or the specialization, but I've been finding it too easy. I wish it could be more challenging and that it could offer me more opportunities do practice.",3
40633,"Interesting but basic course. Mostly a series of tips on how to take advantage of human susceptibility to persuasion. The last week, concerning how to resist attempts to manipulate you, was probably the most important.",3
5008,"The course content was very interesting, however, the way it was presented was very dull and monotonous. The script was great - very insightful and informative, but having the presenter talk for the whole lecture without more frequent use of diagrams, figures, etc. to help understand the concepts is not helpful and incomprehensible to me. Specially when it comes to a course with so much geographical content, it would be good to have a more consistent depiction of maps. Furthermore, with all the new concepts, visual aid would help students understand what things are and what they look like since the backgrounds chosen for the lectures have little or nothing to do with the course whatsoever.On the other hand, I do think that the questions throughout the videos are extremely useful as they (usually) tackle problems that were not mentioned previously and gets the student to think independently. Finally, the end of lesson tests always have one or two challenging questions which is great. This course has a 5 star potential, so I hope the reviews are being read so they can work towards that goal!",3
16622,Personally they should add a free textbook and a vocabulary list with clear examples.So yes this course could benefit from more detail time to time,3
24447,"The course provides a very thorough introduction on the basic models and mechanisms by which various financial products are priced. One issue I had, was that the quiz questions sometimes used terminology or jargon for which the link with the material covered in the videos was not always immediately obvious. Also, the course, especially the later modules, heavily relies on Microsoft Excel, which some people might not be willing to pay hard cash for. It is possible to pass by doing the assignments with e.g. Python, but it's a lot of work, and not for the faint of heart.",3
92359,I think most of code should write enrolled students. How can you learn something just copying lines of code and making minor changes? Or just running already wrote code like in the last section?,3
104677,"I thought the videos and interviews were great but I would prefer these separated from the lectures on tangible material. I kind of feel like the course was rudderless and just gave some headlines and then said to go figure it out on your own, but be inspired by all of these extremely successful people. I would like to see the course get into more depth, for example where to start on market research. Where to start on budgeting, and how to go about developing some of these specific business aspects. I enjoy shlmo's lectures but just wish some of this course ""zoomed in"" to me and seemed too ""zoomed out""",3
98705,"Brian, Jeff, and Roger: Thank you very much for all the data science courses, really great. I generally rate them 5 stars. But for this one, I'm giving 3 stars, not because the content is not good (it is; it provides good practical and experiential information), but rather because the material seems repetitive at times either within the same course or with topics in the other courses. Also, the sequencing and lectures seem sometime a bit disjointed.May I humbly suggest an idea: Integrate the key points of this course relating to real-world examples and the sharing of real-world experiences into one of the other courses.Thank you.Robert Al-Jaar, PhDrobert.aljaar@rassociates.biz",3
75630,This course is comparatively easy,3
8360,The classes could have been delivered by creating more interest.,3
88670,I thought this was a good course. Dr. Chuck goes through an interesting example of going through email data and there is plenty of time to do your own project.,3
99594,A bit boring – way too basic. And I expected it to be a bit more systematic – simple (and quite fragmented) examples around one case... Could be a bit more.,3
62953,"Good course, but could have explored the topic with more depth.",3
15495,Good start with Fundamentals. Need to take more advanced courses to gain indepth knowledge.,3
38607,It provides me with exercises to practice but some of the videos explain things awfully or just not at all. Others are good. The discussion boards are helpful. I just wish they didn't talk as much about what something is as opposed to how it works. Many videos often don't show any code or very little which makes understand syntax difficult.,3
93747,"The programming assignments are a great way to get your hands dirty with R, but this is not a course for someone without any prior programming experience, and I found the lectures didn't have much connection with the assignments.",3
97956,"Content is fairly good with weak story line and connection across the various modules. Also the lack of in session quiz modules or weekly quiz module to re-inforce learning is disappointing.It's also possible that i was expecting a lot from a course on design thinking and what it turned out to be was just a scratching of the surface of what the definition of Design Thinking is all about. Having read numerous books on Lean Thinking, Agile development, Minimum Viable Propositions, etc. I was really expecting a solid rigorous approach to the world of design thinking.This course let me down and I just managed to scrape through at the end...almost gave up.",3
25014,"I liked the assignments and the creative ideas discussed in the class. However, I wish there had been more practical, step-by-step instruction in approaching design work; game artists of more diverse styles; and some discussion of game character design as a career.",3
2873,I rated this as a 3 though I got a lot more out of the concepts and the class in the way it was taught than I had when reading books and literature on the subject. I would have wanted more discussions with cohorts taking the class to help cement the practices by virtue of seeing it from other perspectives in different work environments. I can imagine the same class with a moderator and someone facilitating the discussions would get me to the 5 rating. In a nutshell the content is great the experience of the class could be at a higher level then what I experienced.,3
83414,Not enough exercises. Better have at least 10 programming exercises for each week. More difficult material = more exercises.,3
88093,"A very good introductory course. The teacher is excellent as are the video lectures.Unfortunately, the new Coursera rules requiring payment before assessments can be accessed meant that I didn't complete any of the assessments. That will probably be a major disincentive for many learners who want to confirm what they have learned.Also, UCI have elected to disable the discussion forums for this course (although I found they could still be accessed via the Coursera App on my Android phone). I can't help wondering if this was as a result of some of the negative feedback posted on the forums in the earlier courses of this specialisation. If so, this really doesn't reflect well on UCI as a teaching institution!",3
103408,"An excellent course for students that require, or want intricate detail on the subject. Not really designed for casual interest, more likely for the philosophy major. Presented very clearly and the discussions and material were interesting. Would have been four stars but the final quiz was excessively difficult.",3
40238,Prefer more references/examples shown in lectures.,3
32952,"I liked the topics. However, i've liked this course to review the concepts of forms and the types associated: radio buttons, combobox, etc.",3
87679,very very basic course looking forward to advance version of it.,3
21802,"decent enough but this is a heavy subject and really it is not that interesting although clearly necessary. I feel maybe it could have been organized better to make it more interesting Also reading some of Haldey wickhams book he deliberately keeps this part of Data Science away from new learners as it can be a bit dreary, so my recommendation would be to do some of the other courses first.",3
17383,"I consider the assignment is not very useful. Network plot usually does not help much if you are researching dataset. Scatterplot, histogram can be much useful. Tableau? Sorry, can't afford it, why not excel? At least, almost anyone uses it. Not very practical one, but it does contains a lot of information in the course.",3
94391,Quite a lot of material to cover in such a short time!,3
60873,Entry level for writing English emails.,3
19715,Needs to be updated. Also correct some errors.,3
38710,The videos are great. The activities are fine. The final activity needs more structure/scaffolding.,3
25371,"This course was mostly working on the same document, and refining it for six weeks. I kind of wanted a little more from the class beside extended peer review time. I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the specialization's courses, but I didn't think this one was quite up to the same caliber.",3
36652,Great course to get an introduction into the world of finance and it's multiple faces.,3
70884,"The instructer is not fluid, a ""mentor"" is devoid of critical thinking in communicating through the discussions section, the peers are reviewing haphazardly while ""mentors"" offer their own essays (from the past?) where they use material outside of the course readings which may sound plagiarizing after that long warning in each introductory section for writing assignements.",3
36672,"This might be a great course for those who don't have any previous background in Finance/Business.The course will give you a very introductory observations about modern finance. Tests are quite simple, more suitable for high school, probably. No math required. That's a nonsense for a finance course, but still.",3
18661,"The first week was a bit slow, but things picked up a bit after that. If you have programming experience, this course is not very challenging.",3
90128,"Great course! but there was too little content!!!! Double it !! Or double the coursework! make us do more work! Also, tell people to use 'parfor' to speed up the computations.Otherwise, great course!",3
47803,not very useful,3
22326,"Recommend the Introduction to Financial Accounting Course from UPenn, which is more informative and more engaging.",3
85818,"The information is quite useful, but they are not provided in an organised way. Sometimes, I got confused because of overlapping materials. However, in general, it's a good course to have an overview and some useful tools of project management.",3
40873,"Covers the basic of Linear Regression, would like to see more advanced material.",3
91943,"The teacher was wonderful as always. The course is given with sqllite, I would have liked a bit more experience with raw SQL queries. But the course shows you how to create and manage your databases with Python in an efficient way.",3
68260,thanks to prof and cousera for this wonderful course. I wish the programming part was taught separately from basic. I have taken the previous course which was case study approach with respect to which it was slightly tough.,3
95009,"The explanation and content in teaching video is too brief for the assignment. It cannot not provide sufficient concept and knowledge for student to complete it, especially who not familiar with pandas.",3
10007,"Not for beginners in the slightest. Enjoyed the videos. But the quiz just made me feel stupid as I didn't have a clue on any of the equations and simulators I was supposed to use. It got me thinking of how ignorant clever people continue to be! Every time a smart person comes up with a new theory it's taken as fact. Give it a couple of decades and someone will prove it wrong. The sun orbiting us proving wrong, easth is flat, gas giants only orbit outside the habitable zone etc etc etc. So when will we learn that just because something happens on this planet doesn't mean it will, has happened elsewhere. The deepest depths of the ocean have life forms, yet we'd perish. So who's to say life forms can't exact on a planet, moon that is nothing like the earth! The world is still at the centre of the universe to these academics!",3
5681,Not enough coding opportunities.,3
102372,Great lectures. I really enjoy discovering the world of the teacher and friends. I'll give it 3 stars since it doesn't arrive at an awe inspiring conclusion or life changing experience as somebody interesting into these subject would expect. The part where our own importance is challenge is enlightening. Cheers to the good professor.,3
27797,Great course to introduce you to basics of graphic design and basic design language.,3

82302,"Liked this course, entertaining and challenging. Although Im not sure how useful meteor is in the real world.",3
93083,"I had indeed to look for codecamp to practice all the small commands how to deal with vectors. Swirl does not allow you to follow up so clearly. I wish you guys could implement a little R interface so we can follow you closer.The last project quiz demands you a huge amount of time, if you do not have much experience. They could shorten a little the questions. I know that one takes to the other, but I only had time to finish the first and understand. Yes, perhaps I am not the best, but you are offering the course to people who are not born programmers.I think that it would benefit strongly from a clear distinction between how to deal with vectors, matrix, data.frame, etc. separately instead of the huge videos with bullet points of the potentialities. We need to practice more, I like theory and I know how important, but I dont think that I learn much from the lessons or quizzes how to code something like the last part. I dont think it build my knowledge until I understand how to create that script for week4. I had to look around in all the internet, buying books. Read more. Just my opinion. I think you guys could give small scripts or asking smaller tasks to lead people until they understand how to build that.Also has its positives, I really learnt great tips and technically I know a lot of R potential.",3
104255,"Easy to follow and well-packed with good information and tips, but I would like to see some kind of quiz-function along the course to test the knowledge I've been learning.",3
98487,I found the video lectures less helpful with this course (than the quantitative course) and resorted to reading the transcripts in order to learn the important information. I did enjoy the assignments ( observation and interview processes) and found the application helped better understand the theory.,3
34420,Level of difficulty low,3
45489,"Very good course, but I did't like how the last week focused on test taking. The course should focus more on 'learning how to learn,' not how to ace a test. In that regard, I felt the course began to be oriented more towards students rather than working adults. Why not spend more time on learning how to think innovatively?",3
10657,"needed more depth, which still could have been achieved in a 1-week format",3
98220,"Interesting, and helpful.",3
25156,Some points were technical making a key understanding of how to present a resume,3
7202,"The course takes a broad approach to the subject.What I miss: the study material should provide more and better organized (theoretical) information (e.g. on topcis like database design, data structures, etc.)What I like: presenting of current software projects around big data",3

105136,I would of like to study succesful cases with performance indicators and their impact in sustainable development of their action region.,3
74559,"too basic for me, excellent for programming newbies",3
83965,"After also learning R from a non-Coursera MOOC, I find this Coursera course clunky and distractingly esoteric. Coursera occasionally crashes when attempting to parse or record the Python code that I've written, when that code runs fine on a regular IDE. This course in particular also includes lots of optional content that is either unnecessary (The Best Taco in the World video, for example) or for which it is unclear how to apply to Python (An interview with the inventor of JQuery, for example). Additionally, the instructor often assigns variable names that don't explain what the variable represents, which makes the videos a bit harder to follow than necessary. Despite all of this, I have learned a lot from this course.",3
38636,Good course. Bad arrangement!,3
62413,Very interesting to have a broad view of how marketing tools create value to consumer nowadays.,3
72203,"Clearly, the instructor is passionate about the Beatles (as am I). However it's really hard to talk about the music of the Beatles and not nine able to even quote from their songs, much less play their music! No songs, no music for fear of being sued!Takes a good deal away from the course!",3
98264,Very good information a little confusion with the regression it's like doing algebra but I like the course.,3
48162,"Meh.I appreciated the new perspectives on learning, and the smaller chunks of video and assignments (which allowed me to spread the work out over the week).The ""Thanks for Learning about Learning"" phrase was fine for the course introduction and the final module, but became annoying as the closing phrase. of. every. video.Dr Sejnowski's skills are reading a teleprompter distracted me - I suggest doing some practice and redoing the videos when the TP won't be such a distraction (watching his eyes track back and forth didn't do it for me).",3
92782,The homework is more harder than what I learned. The errors in speaking made me uncomfortable.,3
3290,"A whole lot of information to absorb, that I will definitely agree with! If there was anything I wish went into more detail, there would be two things.1) Yo / Yeoman: This part of the course was more of an ""Obligatory"" lecture, just to say it's mentioned. I watched that one video many times over, but still ended up going to YouTube for actual ""training"" on the ins and outs. I know time is constrained in MOOC's and you don't get the full load of knowledge you would in a traditional school. However, my thoughts are that either give us an exercise so we can at least have that as experience in using it, or just remove it completely. The lecture was put together as a sort of ""Follow Along"", but it really felt rushed and more of an ""Obligatory"" thing than an actual lesson.2) Give us more detail on the difference between Services and Factories. Keep in mind that I still have Multi-Platform Mobile App Development, and Server Side Development with Node.js still to go, so I don't know if these are explained more in those courses. As it stands right now, I -still- don't know the difference between a factory and a service, or even what a provider is. When should I use a factory? When should I use a service? Which is better suited for what task? All those questions I do not have an answer for after this course, which feels a bit short for me.",3
98555,"Good, but it lacks proper materials to come back to - slides are very heavy and not clear and transcript is missing connections to slides.",3
25011,"I would like a different approach on the way this course is given to the student. The first couple of classes were really cool and inspiring, but the later two became more of the same and kinda took my inspiration and motivation down to finish the course.",3
15170,"Quite basic, but good to set the needed programs",3
101336,"This is a quick run-through different types of distributions. I found it useful as a recap of things I learned in high school (!) and there were some additional insights. However, I think this course might be hard if you never did any more advanced (high school) math.",3
21458,"Good course to start with the basics of photography. Group assessments can be hit or miss given varied experiences of other students, but overall a good place to start",3
8278,Good course if you do not have any idea about Big Data and the technology used.,3
14755,"The course is basic, and quite simple. Some might say too simple. I think it should be about 1 week long. I already knew all the things going into it so it was easy to finish it over two days.",3
15038,It's way to easy to be a separate course. It should be part of R Programming.,3
20695,Course content was pretty detailed. I did not like that I had to write down pretty much every single word from each slide and that was said in order to make sure I could answer the quiz questions. Either the quiz questions were bad or it was taught in a confusing manner. I would go with the former.,3
39394,"I liked the assignment, and the course... for the most part. What I didn't care for was so much time being spent on the IBM BlueMix and other software tutorials. I don't really see the value in those software, and it felt very sales pitch-y. I can't imagine using them in my day to day, so it just felt like a waste of time. But I did like all other aspects of this course, including the Taco Bell insight, as well as the details on Social Mention and the other free web applications that is more pertinent to future social work.",3
22721,Basic stuff.Good choice of subjects.A little too short.,3
63668,The course is good but I'd like a more complicated one. This is too easy.,3
17061,Not practical enough,3
29740,"There is a problem with the peer reviewing of the assignment. Even you finished all tasks, you need to wait for receiving your grade. For example, I am still waiting for the grade of my assignments, specially I am waiting for more than two weeks for the grading of my assignment in week 2.",3

88086,Expected more based on the arduino course. Very lite on material,3
105894,"It gives a well based numeric approach to sustainable development, but fails to approach some subjects from an ethical point of view. At some time, Prof. Sachs points out a few numeric indicators that favor economic development, but when talking about reaching these numbers, he offers more than debatable ways.",3
32312,A lot of outdated information. A lot of mistakes. But still a good way to understand the basics.,3
10044,"The accent of this teacher made me struggle to comprehend some of the most basic concepts she was presenting. I learned way much more on the previous modules of this specialization.The course should be 2/5 stars, but thanks to Boston and McKenzie articles, I will give an extra one.",3
36341,"The lectures are often superfluous and the professor keeps jumping from subject to subject. From the mathematical side, the course is also rather shallow. Half of the first week quiz verifies knowledge that in my opinion has no practical importance (not something to remember).",3
88793,There were a number of different instructors and it was great to have a taste of varying topics from them.,3
36458,good course and good explanation by Prof.Shiller but a lot of videos were edited like a few parts of the video were deleted. Also I felt like Prof.Shiller sometimes did not explain all the concepts to the full extent which I felt made it a bit difficult for a beginner like me to fully understand what he was teaching,3
34649,"Pros: Really motivating!Cons: Not much real content even for a beginner, too short.",3
92182,I loved the teaching. The video are great and the examples too... But I almost did not program! The course is 'too easy' and I feel I did not practice enough!,3
25403,"This course as much content in it and it's difficult to have an holistic idea how it all fits together. Some videos are taught having the same problem like, for example, some tools/themes are presented without us knowing what they are for. E.g., Chi-squared test and null hypothesis. Only after a while we understand their use. This bring a lot of overhead to us who are learning.Some videos seem to have been re-worked over time and present cuts or jumps.As for assignments, they should be better worked because some questions are not clear or misleading regarding the criteria that you want to evaluate.For example, I already reported that in Question 2. and 3. of the assignment for the 3rd week. The example you give is a short introduction with two problems: 1) ""I did the website"", which can make the participant not to be at ease to criticize and 2) we're no evaluating the participant performance but the website. Next, you ask us to rewrite the introduction, which we do with those two problems in mind. Now, when we do the peer review we realize that you're expecting for us to rate the new introduction based on having ""early prototype"" and ""user feedback"". The original problems just seem not to count. Only by chance you can eventually write the new introduction touching the points that count for grading.",3
60706,Good Course,3
22749,It is very useful for someone with only basic finance knowledge,3
68505,"I think this course is a relatively well put together, gentle introduction to machine learning. It would be good for people with zero experience with ML, who might be overwhelmed by other ML courses (Ng, Abu-Mostafa) out there. This course would not be useful for anyone who has any previous knowledge of ML.Many reviewers have taken issue with the software used. I actually liked the Dato libraries a lot, but I'd be uncomfortable using proprietary software for research. I thought it was friendly enough to be appropriate for this kind of intro class, and I really enjoy iPython notebooks for interactive teaching.I rated this course a 3 because of the price for the full course. This part of the specialization should be free. It does not provide enough instruction, practice, or content for the cost. Multiple choice quizzes are used to grade the programming assignments, so there is no feedback from the instructors. These answers are not made available to students in the free tier, which flies in the face of open learning. I am disappointed in the recent push to monetize courses. Please don't pay for this one.",3

102214,"Good information presented, but I can't get past the outdated teaching method of using the first 45 to 60 seconds of each video to talk about what the video is going to cover, then spending 30 seconds repeating those bullet points at the end of each video. Some videos are 4 minutes long, so more than half of the content is not actually content, it is essentially the instructor reading the outline for the upcoming content. It's a waste of both instructor and learner time. There are errors in the materials, and since there is no instructor feedback/interaction, there is no way to find out what was meant (including in reading assignments). All you can do is submit a ticket to get it fixed and hope that it gets corrected for the next people who take this course.",3
4301,"The instructor should spend more time putting equations and concepts into concept, and tying them together. It often felt like values and questions were arbitrary. This is less about master data analysis in Excel, and more about gaining ground in a few key concepts, so the title is misleading as well.",3
95146,"I enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful, but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem, especially for the last assignment. A simple response of ""this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded"" isn't very constructive and was often frustrating. Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating. I spent a good amount of time trying to fix my code, thinking it was incorrect, when in actuality the online submission was just not working.",3

67054,"The course contains basic informations on neural networks at a quite abstract level. It is not enough to easily understand them without a prior preperation in mathematical details. The quizzes need strict computations based on a detailed knowledge, but usually the course does not prepare You for that. The lectures sometimes sound ""babble"" and cannot explain even easy things.It is usually impossible to get the minimum of 80% in a quiz. These are only those who have previous knowledge that can pass it the first time they take it. They do not need this course, though.",3

74068,A bit easy. Completed in a week,3
71137,"The grading seems to round up to 100%, which makes the assignments that are already generally easy far too easy. I took this course instead of just doing my own thing so that I could get some structure and motivation. While there was some structure, it was quite basic, and the motivation was diminished by ""good enough"" not being much. I was considering taking the later courses in the specialization, but I'm afraid that without real grading I won't learn as much as if I learn more slowly outside of Coursera.",3
73832,"In general, it's very good!1) The interview and other stuff in the bonus video should renamed as optional or other names. It's misleading people to think bonus as materials related for the class.2) As the name is programming for everybody, will be better if some of the explanations or slides can be linked with daily life cases for people to understand the concept easily.",3
99759,I have not really improved TBH.,3
66550,Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums. Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented. And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities. Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists' and art works' intent!,3
79012,"I took this course hoping for a fundamental education in utilizing R for statistical analysis. Unfortunately, this course focuses heavily on statistical methods and very little on explaining the R processes used.

89913,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself ""introduced"" to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons/assignments (presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess?). If this is the case, some outside study/background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while (again...outside study/research required). Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.",3
101405,"I believe this was a very good course for beginners. However, from Wharton, I would have expected more realistic examples. I would have also liked some hands-on assignments. But, otherwise.. Great, great course from a beginners point-of-view! Thank you so much!",3

97600,Average. Doesn't really like the Professor's style. He spends too many time trying to explain that he feels really concern about the victims etc. I feel that the content of the class could have been interesting but the organization was messy. Finally it gives the impression that academics know barely anything about the subject. I would have prefer a more historical approach.

Professor Aric could use a little more energy as he had a very scripted feel to the lecture videos which almost felt like he was reading from the marketing dictionary. However, he was very thorough and informative.",3
83051,"I found plenty of useful information in this course overall but lectures often spent too much time dwelling on the detail of simpler concepts while more complex areas, and sometimes critical information that was later built upon, were only touched briefly or sometimes skipped entirely. I missed a sense of continuity as we skipped from model to model with a minimum of time spent on how the models complement each other and their relative strengths and weaknesses in application.The way data structures were defined in the code was particularly difficult to deal with. The coding exercises all suffered as a result. It ended up taking way too much time to figure how to decode the data and trace logic around it. This meant that grasping concepts and learning from the questions came in a distant second priority to debugging.Dr Koller mentioned that the material is aimed at postgraduates. I felt that the level of content covered here would just as easily be grasped by most undergraduates in technical disciplines if it had been delivered in a more structured manner with clearer progression across models (conceptually and mathematically) and better code examples. When delivering in this format, allowances need to be made for the facts that tutorial sessions do not exist and the possibilities for informal Q&A are limited so any gaps become very difficult for students to fill in themselves.Despite the above shortcomings I'm glad I did the course and I would still recommend it to someone interested in graphical models as it does cover the basics well enough to make a decent start. I'm not sure whether or not I'd recommend the programming exercises as they are a significant time sink but at the same time, without spending time attacking the programming problems the concepts are not likely to gel based on the video and quizzes alone.",3

Not greatly but enough to frustrate. Some quiz questions, with multiple choice options with only one correct answer, will not accept any answer. There are a few questions which are not covered in the video lecture (or covered in later weeks). Some answers can be found in the book (but the book supposedly is not required). Some answers can be googled but the answers vary wildly between sources.Mathematical Thinking from Stanford is the gold standard.",3

9645,"There is some good material in this course. The text is fairly good. But I have two main reservations about the course. The first is that the lectures do not always correspond closely enough with the quizzes, and with the text. There are times when one can take a quiz and think, ""How exactly does this relate to the lectures I just saw?"" The text has quite a few exercises, but there is a tendency to throw in one or two problems whose difficulty is an order of magnitude above everything else in that section, and I find this discouraging and a waste of time. Save those for a later course, or put them into a separate ""Extra Challenges"" section. Learning calculus is hard enough without trying to grapple without some really tricky trig problem at the same time. as a single example.The second reservation is with the instructor's manner. Many students find it very enjoyable. I am not one of them. Much of the time, he's OK, especially when the camera is not pointed at him. But as the course progresses, much of the footage is of him at his desk, and the closeups become more and more extreme, the hand-waving and fist-clenching approach sheer windmilling, and the exaggerated eye-rolling, grinning and so forth become so distracting that I can't bear to watch. I realize that the goal was to avoid being a dry-as-dust droning professor, and that is commendable, but there is a happy middle ground between that and hamming. I can almost speculate that there was an impulse to add in cartoon sproing-bonk-cuckoo-klaxon sound effects. (There is actually one such sound effect, but just one, so I won't quibble on that.)I would have found the class more effective with a demeanor that was enthusiastic without being histrionic. I'm sure this is one of those ""you either love it or hate it"" things, and I may be in the minority.The instructor is not generally one to throw out some concept that has not already been learned and then just motor on without explanation. He errs on the side of overly-detailed explanation, which to me is preferable to skipping over subjects or techniques and assuming you know them.Having said all of this, I repeat that there is good material, and you can learn the fundamentals of calculus for free in this course.",3

Also the lectures would have been more absorbing if they were not just slides with a wall of already inputted code (i.e. a live recording of the coding would have been more informative... like what is done in most other courses)",3
51629,"I'm torn about this course. The instructor's approach and enthusiasm are great, and the content seems fine. But with no direct access to the instructor, interactions come from discussion forums and peer reviewed assignments. The discussion forums were lifeless with virtually no staff participation. Throughout the 4-week course, there was one discussion thread with staff participation. Legitimate questions from students about content errors or technical problems went unacknowledged. Peer review is an understandable part of this course, but it has limited utility as the only feedback mechanism in a course populated by beginners.This course is still quite new. I believe it can and will be much better if the pool of students grows and there is more staff participation. It's still a worthwhile course as is, but a tougher sell than earlier courses in this sequence.",3

But even for inherently objective questions ""Is the code correct?"" (as does it give the correct answer"" the staff does not provide the correct answer... I think the staff should create some automated review for what is objective: does the code compile? does it yield the correct answer? is it efficient enough? (Just like many other courses on Coursera) And only when it passes the automatic review, use peer grading for coding style. Finally there a lot of confusion with the deadlines.Minor comments:Lucky Coursera has an option to play twice faster! Not that the content is too easy, but the talking ... pace ... is ... hum... very ... ... slow. Also how come for a programming course the slides with code are so poorly formated???",3
10861,"This course seems great, although plenty of errors in the audio transcript. The steepness of the learning curve increased very quickly and understandability decreased after week 3, which made me drop the course. I hope to be able to retake it some time in the future with the right mathematical skills.",3
74543,Not enough material though for a full course. This whole course can be done in few hours by people with some experience in programming. Unfortunately this does not provide enough possibilities/assignments to deeply relate to the language and really feel comfortable in it (not even at the beginners level as is the aim of the course). Nice slow introduction though.,3
75367,Parts of videos were distracting and dragged on for longer than necessary.,3
90895,"Overall good course that would definitely make you spend more time reading and learning on the side. Would recommend it those who have good background in college level math like Linear Algebra and a little bit of Robotics Background from a Math perspective - like working with translations, rotations, transformation matrices of that sort to make the transition easier. (There are basic robotic courses online to help with that, like Peter Corke's course). But overall this course requires some significant effort to explore the material from an external perspective.Some issues however -1. Lack of added resources like reading material to support the course and help advanced students go beyond the course themselves.2. Severe lack of activity from TA(s) on the forums. It's good that students get to interact among themselves and learn on their own, but every single post should be either answered by a TA to clarify doubts or they should acknowledge that another student's explanation was good enough to answer a particular question.3. The in-video quizzes weren't up-to-the-mark as per me. One question asked ""why"" and the answer was literally ""because that's how that algorithm is"".4. This is a trend in MOOCs and I don't think it can be helped, but perhaps more assignments that help understand the concepts better with examples would help students go beyond. If this course had such optional assignments that would be great for understanding the concepts with a more hands-on approach. But this is probably not the best platform to do so.Overall would recommend future iterations of this course, especially if the first two points above are improved upon.",3
32376,It was a pain installing the necessary tools for this course for me on Linux. Made it a little difficult to keep up.,3
95002,a decent introduction into the world of python dataframes via the pandas library,3
100514,"The course was of great help. It provides valuable insights to engage in academic research. However, I rate it only with three starts because I think it is too basic for the complexity involved in real research. Also I think some ideas provided in the course could be better organized. For example, in week three, the topic was understood to be something like ""Management Skills Applied to Research"" but the material pointed to something totally different. All ideas presented were great, but I think it is just matter to clarify better the objectives in each week.",3
23337,Good for healthy living,3
21900,Topics were OK but the focus on R and no other tools is frustrating,3
54548,"Good introductory course. It would have been nice to see some more deep mathematical demonstrations of the formulas, at least as optional videos.",3
79305,It's a good course but not great. Something is missing and I can't pinpoint what.,3
18451,"This course is very difficult. I recommend only taking it if you have some experience with syntax. Although very challenging, I learned a ton.",3
29336,"I enjoyed a lot of this course, especially the parts about evolution and social intelligence. Very interesting!! However, as a professional dog trainer and having studied through the Karen Pryor Academy, I was VERY disappointed to see Brian Hare's misunderstanding of clicker training. I would be happy to chat with him about the realities of clicker training and how an event marker works, if he'd be interested ;)Futhermore, I bought the book and paid for a certificate, but because I took over 180 days to complete the course (despite the course being ""self-paced, with suggested deadlines to help you keep on track), I did not get my certificate and was informed that to get it I'd have to pay again for the same product.",3
79290,Helpful and clear.I would like it more if it had more elaboration and practice on the presented tools.Thanks!,3
6025,"short, effective and precise, contain all necessary for a initial learner about Business Model Canvas. In my case, I am an intermediate learner, so it was not enough.",3
83246,I feel content of the presentation need to improve. Second the voice quality also need some improvement it was not clear. It was looking as if some one behind the screen is just reading the slide content. Please elaborate each points mentioned in the slide. In some slides the end content was skipped.Better would be if some person is always present on the screen. It grabs the attention of the listener.,3
93449,"This was a decent introduction to R, but my main issue is that the Data Science specialization is so dependent upon the R language. This course really should be more focused around Python or be more flexible in general.",3
2726,"I was very excited during Week 1 and Week 2 lectures. Then, the videos kept getting unclear and outdated. The assignment is not engaging. My interest dropped. The videos really need updates!",3
25208,"Pros: Information is perfect for anyone looking at Business Intelligence as a career field, or already in the career field itself. I found the first week to challenge my on-the-job knowledge of a fuller set of concepts and general terminology.Cons: The wording on the quiz questions, in some cases, seems much different than the PPT slides and the instructor's language. UPDATE: The wording is a significant challenge, even when advancing into the more complex topics. I have had many differences of opinions on the solutions based on wording in the requirements.",3
50961,"Very theoretical course. If you don't know much about software management, this course might have some good info, but covers things you probably know if you have been involved in any software management.",3
14090,Too little material for 4 weeks. All this could've been written in a PDF instead of videos.,3
19,"The course content is quite good, though it could have been deeper in some areas.But its peer review system is not working well, if at all.Regards, An Le.",3
28693,"The class was absolutely Wonderful, however I don't have the time to go at a student's pace (work , hom, life in general). I was trying to go back and finish week 6 video #4 but was unable to open the course! I want to llearn I wasn't aware there was a time limit to learn happiness. :(",3
14525,This one is just a warm up for the Data Science Specialization.,3
22646,Volume too low.... need more concrete examples.Thank you for your effort though. I learned from the course.,3
91072,An interesting course even if you don't complete the assignments because you can expect to get around an 80% even if you fully grasp the subject matter due to the peer review requirement. The course would be much better without that requirement.,3
13589,"The structure of the class follows the regular academic model you'll find in college: lecture -> lecture -> lecture -> assignment... repeat. I don't think this model is suitable for online delivery. Without discussion and the ability to interrupt and ask questions, the lectures are at times a more frustrating than useful (especially with Coursera's user interface, which lacks quick rewind and is generally speaking rather poorly thought out).For many of the topics, better videos exist online (try safari or pluralsight). As for the problems, they were the main source of learning, but were also at times a bit frustrating (the splay trees starter code was rather sad to look at). I find that hacker rank is probably better at delivering value (if you can forego the warm fuzzy feeling you get from getting a verified certificate, you'll probably be better served by practicing on hacker rank than from doing the problems in this course).",3
27590,This class is very insightful for those interested in pursuing any career having to do with global health or traveling. I am not pursuing a career in this field therefore it didn't entirely appeal to me but Professor Boyd is very passionate and knowledgable at what he does!,3
6054,"Well the course is reasonably well organized the material is in great detail exceeding what I would've thought the overview concept of big history would be. Other big history courses I've taken do not go into specific date and time detail, period by period But function more in terms of how preceding events may be causative for future events (more like a butterfly effect analysis over long periods of time).If you are looking for more detailed specific history than this course is useful. If you are looking for more of the big history overview concept this may not be the best course for you.",3
83085,"This course could have been better in my opinion, if we could have exercise that would deal with the concepts in more detail. I felt myself involved deeply in understanding the problem statement, rather than practicing the concepts explained in the course.",3
28984,"Very good content, oo long, too many words to get to the point, and too many instructions on assignments.",3
40373,"The course presents a clear structure and an interesting approach, including materials on the assessment of minorities. Furthermore, it is well supported in scientific evidence as multimedia materials that help to understand the concepts addressed in the course. However, the materials are someway monotone, the subject is addressed in general terms, which is understandable given the time set for the course, but it may had been better by focusing on concepts instead of examples.",3
26049,"While I enjoyed the projects and found the instructor easy to follow and understand, I was disappointed in how little coding we did. The code walkthroughs were rushed and I barely learned enough to scratch the surface of some of the scripts we used in the basic projects. Since scripting is such a huge part of game development, I feel like there should have been more focus on it. Maybe a new term in each video or something?And I understand that the course was only four weeks, which doesn't allow much time for deep scripting analysis, but maybe the course should be longer than four weeks.Overall a fun class and I now have two games to show off to people.",3
90518,"Course is generall very good and lots of fun!2 things i would change:... the Assignment 1 is too early in the course or the Lectures are disordered, but I needed the second and third week material to do the first weeks assignment.... Add Jupyter Notebooks in the Specialization in addition to Knit-R",3
94504,The instructor is at time incomprehensible. It would be helpful to speak more slowly and pause more often. Otherwise he sounds like repeating something that he's so well memorized after many years of teaching.,3
63857,Very helpful but sometimes it is too slow,3
3160,This was a hard course and many of the exercises did not have enough details to complete the assignments on time. I had to rely on course forums and a lot of googling to finish the course successfully.,3
4377,The class has great concept but it needs a bit more structure and change to hit its full potential.The Good:-The spreadsheets and exercises along with Quiz material. The project was also very informative.The Bad:- The video need to better explain how Area Under Curve and how the Credit model make sense. It was not very intuitive and I struggled for over 2 weeks to put the Project together due to this gap.But a worthwhile class with great potential. I am glad I took it.,3
90115,"The course is ok, it touches on some interesting topics and it serves its purpose as an introductory course. Unfortunately more interesting topics are only briefly mentioned at the end of the last video. I also think the assignments can be improved, some assignments lack documentation, one of them had a coordinate system swapped from what was shown on screen and the evaluation of some assignments are quite tight, even if you have it working, unless you deliver exactly as it is expected you will fail, not to mention what is expected is sometimes blurry.",3
89852,Good quick introduction. Very good. Easy to work through the Exercise Sets. Professor typing on he keyboard quite loud.,3
33913,"This course is good, although it repeats a lot from the Fundamentals of Graphic Design.",3
20235,"It was a fairly good course, the professor is funny and the slideshow itself is well made, but the content sometimes got boring and my mind stepped away from the course, something that did not happen even with other more difficult courses.",3
22977,"Large topic and well presented. Due to volume could perhaps be divided into smaller, more comprehensive,",3
97236,"One of the things that I didn't like is that I couldn't complete the course because, without purchasing the course, I didn't have access to the assignments / quizzes. But the content is good and the Geneva teachers are nice (specially Michel!). Also, some USB guest lectures are not adequate for this type of course, which is for beginners. Sometimes the guest lectures are not even related to the content of the modules where they are presented.",3
93181,Assignments are not good representations of course materials. The Instructor speaks too fast.,3
20576,"A example of the Capstone quiz, could made this course best. I suggest to give example of a business idea analysis and also lecture on it.",3
103726,It's a good explanation about the technologies used on smartphones but it mote a comparison of what we had and what we have now. It's nothing really new and fundamental for this specialization.,3
81401,"It is a very interesting course. I was quite taken.The teacher is good in her solos, and quite good while in the group. I dind't really like the massive use of the terms ""kind of"" (often used to explain concepts) and for this reason I still have to finish it.I will quickly 'cause I 'm looking forward to learning something else.",3
4174,"To complete this course you have to go back and forth for the basic. Also the final assignment is bit ambiguous, more clarity is required.",3
5603,"This course is nice but very lengthy videos and at one points i didn't understand some topics , quiz are pretty tough to solve .",3
52843,"I love the content overall. However, I'm very disappointed that there are no video lectures at all. Ironically, I could find some old video lectures of this course on YouTube. The difficulty of this course warrants video lectures to convey many concepts and techniques, such as the Fitch system.Hopefully you can add video lectures back to this course.",3
30712,"it is very nice course, and improve my english writting style",3
72478,"The material is excelente, But I would like you to promote a little more the community. Due to, sometime is difficult to advance when you don't understand a subject.",3
3566,So So.Not good to learn an algorithm,3
37227,The videos and presentation are fine.The exercises are quite easy and the main problem of the course is that they are review for other students withput any teacher assuring that is right.,3
66992,"This course was helpful in understanding the basics of Julia, but there are still a few things I feel I'm missing. A longer course with more time for advanced details would be better in my opinion.",3
54217,it is a good beginner course with lots of detail.,3
61621,"Good course but it's too much academic, I can see that you were talking things you don't understand or read a script without put any of your efforts.",3
38944,VERY small amount of knowledge,3
38876,"This course is quite challenging for beginners. I tried to do the assignment, the code of the assignment are those that i've never learnt before..i only learnt in the forum. Please review so that learners won't be too stress out..Thanks for your kind attention.",3
82279,The tutorials lack in depth explanation of methods work. This is not a university level course. its more like here is how to do it magically. There is no explanation on how the methods work. or how the meteor achieve what it does.,3
32650,This course is too broad and specific to USA.,3
96827,"The contents of the course are definitely insightful and approrpriately based on scientific research. Dr. Greg Urban is extremely knowleadgeable on the topic.The reason why I am not giving the course a higher rate is because: 1) I find the pace of the course is quite slow, 2) the inactivity in the discussion forums and the lack of peer reviews in the assignments reduces its interactivity and 3) both the contents and grading system are very theoretical.Still, I would recommend this course as it provides a solid foundation on the principles behind the dynamics of culture.",3
12416,"Programming instructions were not clear, and the version of Python that was installed on my machine did not support the Jupy",3
99746,Great basic overview,3
30021,the scholarly writing becomes easier after taking this course. it is definitely an interesting course.,3
25091,Not enough guidance for final project.,3
38261,"Some good content however it is too reliant on reading a lot of white papers and articles. Some of the readings are very good, however a number of them are out of date for example 2012 in a space that has already rapidly evolved since then. I would have liked to see more examples of how people are exploring ways to address vulnerabilities and activities for cybersecurity",3
7075,Helps me a lot understand how to organize knowledge and study better. Thank you very much!,3
18949,Lack of information and clear direction. I could have produced a more cohesive document if all of the deliverables were described from the beginning.,3
98358,"I really enjoyed weeks 1 and 2. They were more business focused. Weeks 3 through 6 were super technical. All in all, it was a great primer for satellite communications. Congrats to the team!",3
99731,"It's a nice course to review good work habits, but it mostly states the obvious.",3
7187,1. The course is very general and high level introduction.2. During the lectures there are some examples that in some cases are presented as very small images and briefly. I personally could not understand some examples presented in week 5.3. I found the hands-on lectures very helpful. I wish there was more that would delve into more examples in more details.4. The course was very overpriced given the amount of information offered compared to other courses I have taken at coursera.Thanks.,3
42915,"My background is a degree in Cognitive Science, and I believe my review may be more specific to this perspective. If your background is psychology/cognitive science/neuroscience, then you may not learn a whole lot of new learning techniques in this course. However, it was an easy and light refresher and provides a lot of useful analogies to reshape (or ingrain deeper) learning techniques you are already aware of. I did learn a few additional learning tools that I plan to implement. If your background is not from one previously mentioned (or similar), this is a great, easy course that will help you learn in all areas of life and is worth taking, esp. for the small time commitment each week relative to the potential life-long benefits.",3
8492,The course is ok but I found that there were some technical quirks that could be ironed out first. Example is to download the text files in the final assignment the command wget is invaluable. How to leave safe mode if the Name node is in safe mode. VirtualBox is default to 32 bit/ubuntu when the image is 64 bit/Centos/Redhat.In addition the course content is a bit little. It says 3 weeks but I finish it in 2 days. Perhaps it is about quality and not quantity.,3
39918,"The teacher is great at performing but the pace of the class is way too fast for me.The assignment is hard.But, hey, that's Berklee.",3
74058,"I really like the main information I got with this course, but I think that it was too basic. I never learned any programming language before this course, but sometimes I felt that the teacher was going too slow on explaining somethings.",3
8817,Too high level,3
88142,New technologies are not explained in detail in a layperson's term.,3
61608,Course was poorly put together with errors that are not fixed.,3
82986,The concepts are very good but very theoretical.More quantitative analysis should be added to prepare students to deal with the real world problems.,3
2395,Very interesting as lay person interested in topic.,3
41139,"A whimsical introduction to game design and the springboard for a Specialization Certificate, therefore important to take.",3
23369,"Short and concise. The course strongly aims for USA residents who eat too much. If you are that person, this course is perfect. As someone from another country without health problems, there was not much here. I was hoping to learn more about food and how to optimize my diet so as to increase energy, improve mood, increase life-expectancy, and reduce chances for depression. I found nothing about that. But it's not so bad because the course took me less than 3 hours and I still picked up a few things :).",3
90877,"All in all the material, videos and assignments were very interesting and they made up an exciting course.However, some of the slides lacked sufficient information on notions or did not make references to supplementary sources. The assignment material (mainly pdfs) sometimes had typos which made solving them a bit confusing and more time consuming without actually being very difficult. Also for both slides and assignments the notations were not always consistent and/or variables disappeared from equations without clear explanations.I hope in the next offering of this course there will be improvements on these aspects.",3
90630,"Who teaching us is a student, and the assignment is not in detail as other class",3
25174,"Some really good pointers. I would have liked to see more for the experienced person, this was quite focused on new college grads.",3

90062,"I really didn't learn much. Too much code, too complex, too fast.",3
80205,more practical projects&homework would be great!,3
39453,A good introduction! Thanks!,3
98346,"Some sections were rather basic, lacking insight on some topics. It may be suitable for people with incipient engineering knowledge but for the slightly trained a bit repetitive. Still, the lectures were quite entertaining and the approach taken remarkable didactic.",3
19640,I find the videos are overly formal and traditional in their rhetorical style. But the course' main contents and Practices are still relevant.,3
88208,Very common RF knowledge and less deeper knowledge than expected. It's an high level introduction but definitely no specialisation.Only the LTE part is much better and in more detail right now.Btw. I don't like presentations with reading only the visible content. We all can read by our self. More spoken details between the lines would be nice.,3
98130,"The course was great. What I had a real problem with was the lack of response for problems with the Honors programming assignments. I never received any feedback from the TA's and when I submitted to MeTa support, they said the school design the programs so they can't help. I got a Segmentation Fault on Assignment one which I never did get resolved. Because of this, I was unable to get the Honors status.",3
104335,The first half of the course was great but 2nd half was a bit disappointing.,3
100271,It is a good course that gives you a general idea about how to manage your time.,3
71796,It includes several information about logistics field but it is not so sophisticated,3
74866,too redundant,3
24277,"Whenever examples were given, things became much clearer, but there often weren't examples. In many instances it would have been nice if there had been a second take of the video taken to prevent potentially confusing mis-speaking from making it into the lectures. Obviously you get what you pay for, and it's great that I got a vague overview of the subject for free, but I easily aced the course without feeling like I'm at all prepared to run an fMRI experiment.",3
18013,There should have been more examples and more use case and more applied rather than just a theoretical discussion,3
98150,"Very theoretical and somewhat dry. If you are interested in applied machine learning techniques (for text retrieval and analysis) this is not really the course to take. Gives a solid background though which, in my opinion, every aspiring data analyst needs.",3
102875,"This course was not as good as the first course. I found myself typing codes mindlessly a lot and feeling the guilt that I'm not learning a lot from the app I'm making because there is too much coding going on and it's not clear what's more important. The final exam was too easy (almost a joke!) and it didn't help me figure out if I actually did learn something by typing out all these codes. I would like more lecture, snippet of codes and explaining what they do and have us fill out part of a code by thinking through as oppose to typing out the whole thing.",3
90730,"Not a beginner course. You need an engineering background to know how to interpret the equations enough to finish the coding assignments in Matlab. Some of the equations presented don't have enough explanation behind them for them to seem in context or to give any idea about how they can be applied.I have a background in electrical engineering, and I studied control systems in undergrad, so I was able to get by. If you can't manage through this course, don't feel like you aren't smart enough to complete it; rather, you just don't have the proper pre-requisites.",3
94848,It was good but so introductoryInstructors just reading the documents,3
21702,It is a course made in 2014,3
38536,Pretty dry.,3
16943,"The course was interesting, but unfortunately it really felt like it was tailored to a male audience. The metaphors, examples (ie ""surely you've taken part in team sports like American Football"") and tone really made it feel like the course was aimed not at me, but at men. As a woman in an industry dominated by men, this was disappointing because I don't believe that I am any less deserving of a place at the top table, but this course made me feel like those kind of jobs weren't for me. I would prefer it if the course leaders would take the time to look at the content of this and other iMBA courses and ensure that the content takes on a more neutral tone, to make it feel more welcoming to people traditionally shut out of very senior roles",3
91595,"This course showed a lot of pre-written code and exposed me to databases. I learned a lot, but felt like I DID less than in the previous specialization courses.",3
6223,The teacher explains concepts very well. Really worth the time to go over the lectures several times.The programming assignments however lack instructions and the online judgement system has some strange requests which are not illustrated in the instruction. You have to guess what the assignment is about each time.Overall very good lectures but poor assignments.,3
88170,"very shalow information, I would like if this course had a contination.",3
11210,"I'm leaving because I can't keep up with an 8 week course given in 4 weeks, and even less if the course keep on refering to the 8 weeks time frame. A pity, I loved this course.",3
94316,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book.",3
13850,"The material and presentation are at the highest level, but the course is lacking real life examples, and contexts.",3
16901,"Not finding it very useful, but it's good to know about the concepts and theories for each type of experiments.",3
7277,I did the free part of the course. It was too simpleI did other free MOOCs that had much more.The videos were like reading a book. The subject is interesting and there's some potential to the practical part of the course.I only did the first 3 weeks,3
60460,Very short. Quality of the course is OK.,3
83243,A bit of repetition with module 1 of the Specialization.,3
86157,"Well structured and informative. Needs more in depth treatment of each section, additional materials( additional suggested reading would be nice), and more excitement from the professor. Thank",3
21040,Definitely recommended for people who have no clue about European law whatsoever. Its informative but partly the course fails to set the right priorities. For example: IMHO it makes little sense to ask for numbers of paragraphs in the quizzes - its not only a waste of time to learn them by heart but also it hinders the participants to show their understanding of the material.,3
9302,"The course is best suited for an Intermediate student. Course is good to have since oit convers the topic from its very basic perspective. For graduates this course is more time consuming and dosnt recommended.Advantages:-very simple descriptions-even a non mathematical background student can easily understand-Proofs in all forms(geometric, analatic, practical) descrition.Disav:-basic are explained and consuming too much time-dosnt going for advanced level-no high level explanations or topics.",3
86283,Wonderful arrangment for learning.,3
1909,Meh. It was just okay.,3
40773,The only reason I give 3 stars is because there were no pdf documents of the lectures. Being able to check back notes fast is important and very helpful and I can't see why they are not given.Other than that the course content was very interesting and fascinating. Well done on that!!,3
68098,The Deep Learning part needs to be improved,3
49476,A very basic course. Could have more in-depth information.,3
64330,"All of the courses lecture are great until it reaches week 5 where it's really hard to catch, the programming assignment doesn't give enough hints and lecture in this topic doesn't help much.",3
73343,"This course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't have. I had to leave the course before completion because of that. In fact, most of the videos were too complex to understand without prior knowledge on the matter and the deadlines are quite tight to have time to research all the topics.I believe the course content is quite interesting; but too complicated. I would appreciate less text and abstract drawings on the slide, maybe an intro with images (maybe 3D) of the human body to give a little bit of background on what's going to be discussed in the class...",3
14175,Github exposition is a little complicated. I believe it could be more detailed. But the rest is very well done!,3
40640,"I found the course was unfortunately slightly dry - I was expecting more from the videos. The speakers know their information and showcase the different types of power and influence you can exert on people and they can exert on you, however, I believe it could have had more real world examples.",3
39098,"Very very basic....needed lots of outside referencing to complete. Needs more material about parsing, semantics and syntactically correct language.",3
14410,There is practically nothing in this course to learn. It can be termed as a introduction to the specialization,3
90578,"Some parts were very useful. Some parts looked useful, but when I tried it in practice, it was almost impossible to do for me. The course wants to make you behave like a machine, for a part of your job. So you have more room in your head to behave the way you want to. But behaving like a machine, I tried, but I can not. Still there are very usefull parts in this course. I did about 4/5 of the course.",3
98188,"Great course, but sometime it is boring since the introductor just read materials. Hope this can be improved in the future.",3
62633,"The professor is a bit monotone, he needs to be more animated. There are too many assignments , not all can be done while living outside the United States.",3
52082,"Seemed like a good course, however I could not stand this professor's voice so if that doesn't bother you I'm sure it is decent. (it might possibly be the poor audio that is off putting as well)",3
73883,A good course for the beginners. The language and explanations are very very simple.,3
89641,It was short and interesting... and that is good. In the first week the readings were overwhelming and I was disappointed - but the other 5 weeks had short videos of interviews with photographers to go along with the concepts presented. Some of the quiz questions were looking for details that I felt were not important for the learner. Final assignment was good.,3
82745,Worse than Scala Principles - too chaotic.,3
99682,Good course overall,3
48723,"A good course who teaches the way you have to do to write correctly a scientific paper, and gives an idea about the process of publish, it is useful and necessary for those who wants to continuous study and have their own work knows on the fields who works and research.",3
36657,"Great professor and good content.The biggest problem with this course is the quizzes: not challenging and requires no critical thinking. I was hoping to come into this course doing quizzes that Prof. Shiller gives his Yale students, but I was completely disappointed.Moreover, there are some technical issues with the videos. A lot of them cut off in the middle and I ended up having to go to Youtube to find the full versions.",3
20983,"Overall, this was good study for learning basic functions in Excel. However, the tutorials and practice quizzes do not adequately prepare you for the actual graded Quiz at the end of each week that counts toward your final grade. You will definitely have to be either a quick study, who can pull a lot of inference and practical application out of minimal technical guidance, or know how to Google the steps that were glossed over in the videos or for which no practice question was provided. Also, side note, if you have a Mac, you will be somewhat flustered at times, and you will also need an add-on app for the Histogram portion.",3
70286,The course is too much focused on the U.S.,3

321,"It's ok. Bushee is very knowledgeable and a very enthusiastic teacher, but his lessons are too dense compared to the content in the rest of the Wharton BA programs. I actually like all the detail, but I think it's covered too quickly and the course should probably be made longer to deal with it all. There are ratios and balance sheet jargon just flying at you at a breathless pace. It would be better to focus on a few key ones and then walk through the examples a little more slowly. The quizzes were extremely tricky with too many choose more than one answers. It was difficult to find the parts of the video to review missed questions because 1) the transcripts are machine generated and make it difficult to search specific words and 2) it's difficult to remember where the concept was covered because there was so much in each video.The last week felt very disconnected from the first week and like it belonged in a different course almost. It was pretty good, though. I liked how it contained specific examples and charts.",3

61125,"Nice course, though much of the content is relatively basic and only qualitative (for a professional, might be good for a new student). Wouldn't recommend following *all* the advice (e.g. on topics such as debt) but it's anyway interesting to have the perspective, and it definitely makes very interesting points.",3
92195,"I missed more details and exercises on the last part of the course. For example, that geoload/geodump/where-data could be given as exercises during the course and joined at the end to make that map solution.",3
35646,Great content- videos and assignments were fantastic.Little partecipation and interaction with staff and other partecipants makes the course lose a lot of its attractiveness- most of the concepts are not rocket science and one would really benefit from confrontation with other students.,3

71257,1) quite academic assignments which are hard from the 1st one and are very far from regular programmer's job2) very quiet voice/record made it really-really hard to listen the course in subway/metro,3

106858,"Provides good basic information. The assignments are simple and can easily be ""passed"" by following directions, not necessarily by writing well. Many reviews say the critiquing is the draw-point of this class, but that is all done by fellow students not by publishing experts or professionals.

39400,I found the monitoring tools a bit difficult to grasp in the time frame.,3
69749,"It's a great course! The only thing I did not fully like was the we could not learn any of the characters. I guess this course helped to develop the tones and the recognition of them, but, I think that a little shape in the characters and how each sound could improve this course a lot.",3
67130,I liked the content of this course and for the most part I thought it was pretty decent. I just felt that the lectures needed a bit more structure since there didn't seem to be a very good transition between topics. The some of the quiz questions in this course were broken since they were missing details that we crucial to answering the questions (missing weights or having wrong answers since the posted values didn't align with the answer).,3
79369,Can improve.,3
10154,The instructor's lecture sounded too robotic and I feel like he didn't make any effort to explain some of the principles or simplify the course to the audience. It feels like he just copied concepts and pasted them into the lecture and then read them quick.,3
60457,Concise overview. Worthwhile introduction.,3
12259,Has good collection of resources for improvement of communication skills,3
104955,"I think the theory is too dense, but with a weak link with R. I understood better with swirl than with the videos. I'd suggest a more organized video with less draws and annotations. They confused me sometimes.",3
34036,"The content of the class is very nice. It gives a nice overview on genetics, and it was made accessible to many of us. Also, Mohamed Noor is very enthusiastic, and provides a lot of nice examples to illustrate the course. However, I think some parts of the class were a little bit dizorganized. For instance, I was sometimes confused by the vocabulary or the variable notations which are not always clear.",3
22397,Assignment is only allowed for students who purchased the course. I don't think this is a way to encourage learning.,3
90337,"Interesting topics, but not taught in the most interesting way. The professor answered in his lecture videos some of my basic questions about advertising, but I don't think that he made the class very exciting and I didn't feel motivated to seek out outside material. I'm glad I took this course, but I don't think that I would recommend it to many other people.",3
67838,"My opinion:Not much monitoring of the forums by mentors\instructors, hence responses are non- existent\delayed\misleading. some of the replies by mentors were misleading, The rationale of the Volt-sec balance was not set out very clearly, The expression evaluator is very temperamental, i had to enter the expressions many times , a very time-consuming & frustrating process.",3
82758,The main difficulty of the task does not apply to the course,3
82676,"A daily demanding course, which could have benefitted from more time spent in some areas - particular signals. The video explaining a sample Signal implementation was very rushed and provided too little detail on a lot of information that seems to be taken for granted.",3
6604,"The positive.What a wealth of material! This is a very worthy attempt to integrate the history, philosophical underpinnings and modern transformations of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.Clifford Saron’s Week 2 lectures on neuroscience and neuroplasticity were fascinating and intriguing introductions to the topic - very engaging.The negative.Too academic for an introductory course. David Germano’s lectures are full of information but he doesn’t help the learner to make sense of it. His ‘academic speak’ obfuscates meaning rather than making it accessible. More diagrammatic slides at the start would give learners a framework of the overarching concepts.Because of the many perspectives presented each week, this course needs A LOT of time. I personally would have leaned better if the course were broken into smaller weekly segments.",3
94368,"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization (except of ""data product"") and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course.I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before..",3
79417,"Although an excellent course, it seemed a bit too easy - not challenging enough.",3
21280,"Interesting stuff, but not a lot of detail",3
92777,"This course is too easy and more like a user manual, I wish there are more ""Why"" or ""principles"" inside. because the most important thing is to know ""why"". In my eye, ""functional programming Principles in Scala"" is this kind of real course that after taking it (it is not my priority right now so I will delay to finish it for a while). I can get the sense of the most important feature of a new language.",3
104989,"This is a great course taught by a clever teacher but...The content is presented in a very dry, not easy to grasp, manner. In several cases, I had to use external sources to understand the content and/or derive it by myself. When I finally understood the content I couldn't understand why it is presented in such a cryptic manner when the concepts are rather simple to grasp and the math not so advanced.Professor Caffo is a good communicator in some occasion (the module on Power for example was incredibly well communicated). But most of the time he just throw us some result without properly setting the context and concepts, as if it was understood that we already know most of what he is talking about. (Not the case!)I plan to make a document that follows the course module and fill in the missing piece of contextual information, derivations and concepts. But this takes a lot of time. If/when it will be completed, I will try to find a way to share it with future generation of students. Because, honestly, the content of this course is not so hard and shouldn't be!",3
98962,The assignments took me much longer than the suggested 3 hours. Every task depends on having completed the previous task perfectly. My assignment in week 4 passed the end to end test perfectly on my local computer but failed the grader. I traced the problem back to a tiny typo that I made in week 2 assignment. (My heart sank when I saw I had to reuse my week 2 work in week 4 as I knew how much messing around I had done to get that one through the grader - I knew it would give problems)As there were a couple of mistakes in the course (for example if you follow the steps in assignment 3 correctly then the final rspec would give failures - obviously this wasn't picked up by lecturers) it creates confusion and doubt as to whether you have made the mistake or the tutors.The course content is good but the assignments need to be shorter and more forgiving of mistakes (i.e make the individual tasks independent of one another and pass if you get 80%). I am not sure if I will continue with the specialisation right now. It seems more suited to someone who is studying full time and not someone who is working who has limited spare time.,3
40367,"Of course, this course will give a whole idea about the India of contemporary time.",3
42410,"Though the content is great, it is kind of messy altogether! At the end Prof. Green strongly invites us to enroll for a degree in his field at the university of Maryland and there wouldn't be any problem with that without the kind of messy feeling that the course leaves you with. When you put both together it awfully seems like the university tried to diversify its communication and that the only objective of the course is that you enroll in a degree. At the same time, the technical issues of some lectures give a relatively bad image of the university of Maryland...Too sad because again, the content in most videos is great... Just reorganize it and put it together with more cohesion. Among other peer reviews would be preferable to the current way of testing...",3
97803,"This course provides a good understanding of the DT steps with concrete application examples. However, it requires additional readings to be able to apply this learning",3
39970,"The material was amazing (thank you!), but for those who audit, being excluded from the discussions and the tests at the end of each unit made for a ""less than"" experience. Please don't call yourself a MOOC if the free content is so different from the paid version. I'd like for my Coursera listed courses to show this as complete (but without the badge or Yale specific recognition) but it shows that I didn't complete the course, didn't meet the deadlines because I can't do (although I can see) the needed assignments. For me, I don't need badges or certificates, but I do like being able to access and do everything within a course. This ""less than"" experience isn't how most Coursera courses work. If the content wasn't so amazing, I would have given even fewer stars.",3
50765,"Good information, but the material is a little dry (the subsequent courses in the specialization are much more fun) - it's hard to make the introduction exciting, but adding some interactivity would be helpful.",3

It almost made me quit using bower forever.",3
60958,"Content is good, but exercises could be improved, should also add a few interactive quizzes (e.g. a quiz before the segment to ask what they think are the 3 - 4 factors of X,Y,Z; then a quiz at end to summarize). Also add sources.",3

I wish there were a follow up one, like a level 2.I also wish that Brian didn't refer to groups of dogs as ""dog packs"" as dogs are not pack animals. This leads to confusion as dog owners will then believe that they need to be a pack leader and everything that comes with that stereotype. I also wish he didn't focus so much on the idea that dogs are from wolves, because again, many people revert to ""this is how wolves are so this is how i treat my dog"" it leads to confusion. Just read the comments on some threads. Even while doing this course, people were saying how they need to be a pack leader and how they follow what Cesar Milan does.However, for those of us that know there is a difference, it was interesting to learn more about the differences between wolves and dogs. I just wish the course focused more on dogs",3

41060,Very little content. Most of the value comes from working on games for the assignments.,3

102626,The Professor is excellent. I enjoyed this course solely because of Professor Wright. If you have a positive outlook on Buddhism but do not know the ins and outs of the religion/practice I do not recommend this course. I have a totally different outlook on it now that I wish I didn't have. It is interesting information but the essays are in depth and difficult...and there is no chance to even purchase a certificate.,3
70234,"It gets 3 stars only because I learned new things in the class. But the teacher (Bless his heart for meaning well) ended up being rather annoying and distracting with his constant antics. It's okay to throw that in every now and then but this was really awful, makes you want to forward to the parts where he is normal. That's when you can pay attention to him and understand it all. Think you should ask him to tone it down big time... Everything in small doses is great.I think there is an unfair marking system in the last week - I wrote about it too. I don't want to pay for a course and have my points cut for silly reasons. If that's how it works, I never want to pay for certificates. What's the point in paying for 'subjectivity' or 'having to adapt my answers to suit the course'.",3

I believe he knows the English language very well but, between his deep accent and speaking very quickly, there are a number of times I cannot understand what he is saying. This is reflected at times when reading the transcript below each video. I found it better to slow the video down to 0.75X the regular speed to hear him but that did not remove all of the difficulty.",3

Overall I enjoyed it and it was good as a hand-hold through the pre-Socratics and some of the most essential Platonic writings.Pros: the videos are pretty easy to understand, and the material chosen/covered is good to know.Cons: the video quiz questions are really...dull...and there are too many. A downside of the ease of the videos/lectures is that they don't really go that in depth, and they're nowhere near the quality I've seen in other Coursera courses (like the Kierkegaard course from UCopenhagen).",3

Week three material isn't explained at all and for a beginner, it is very difficult. I wouldn't recommend this course to a beginner at all. What i did like about the course was that the material is organized but that doesnt help if you dont understand what is being taught. I dropped out of this course at week 3. Good Luck.",3
85301,"The professor's view of Plato is unique and interesting. I would not recommend this as a first look at the Dialogues, however. Also, it was difficult to see how the lectures connected to the remit of the course, to teach ""reason and persuasion"", in Plato's view. The course was more of a ""modern take on ancient questions"".",3
81096,"I have to admit, this course greatly disappointed me from the beginning. The main reason is its title; it should have been ""Macroeconomics of the USA"". The instructor focuses too heavily on the US economy, which is partially understandable due to its significance, but I personally got tired of the endless supply of facts (and opinions) about US Presidents and their choices on US Macroeconomic Policy over the last 80 years.Other than that, the main concepts of Macroeconomics are presented with adequate detail. I had very little background in Economics but managed to grasp them rather easily. The presentations are pretty dull, however, with the professor mainly reading through the slides (which mind you are NOT in downloadable form).All in all, it's not a bad course, but there is great room for improvement.",3

34199,This course very briefly presents large picture concepts of Entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit. I would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall. The quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall. i.e. questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey.,3

33498,"In the past few years I have taken a number of HTML courses and I know the basics quite well. This is a 'beginner's course' but the final coding project was next to impossible to pass. There was a quiz that would allow you to pass the course without having your code correct. Although my code validated before I submitted it , I got it wrong on the quiz three times and it never did go through correctly!!. I did pass the course with a final grade of 94% but I don't feel confident in my coding ability at all. It would be fine if I had received some feedback showing where the problems were. Without it I have no idea what went wrong. Very frustrating.",3

85547,The answer choices for the quiz are so obvious and can be easily guessed. It can be improved to make the student really think. Also the final quiz is just a repetition of questions we see in the module quiz. It can be different to test the effectiveness of the student.,3

17788,"I wanted to like this course but It felt entirely too academic in terms of both the subject matter and the way the specifics of ""data science"" are presented. The course content reminded me of my time a few years ago when I was enrolled in a Ph.D. program at a major Tier 1 research university. The professors were great, but the content was esoteric and incredibly focused on research based ""data science"" and less on business analytics or more practical applications of data science for the working professional. I felt myself re-watching the videos to try and understand the content because there were many instances where the professors' spoke about some fundamental aspect of data science but failed to provide some real world context. I liked the course but I would not recommend it as a crash course for the working professional, more like a crash course for someone who already has a degree in statistics/math/engineering who is looking to further their studies in an academic setting where research is the main goal.",3
17290,"The lectures are all just the right length. As a working professional, it was easy to consume the course in my varying bits of free time. For the most part, the assignments were good. There were a few places where there were mistakes in the instructions or the code downloaded from github had some errors. It was fairly clear that these mistakes have been around for quite sometime, so I wonder why nobody ever bothered to update the code in github or update the bad instructions. This is the internet, not a published textbook. That should be pretty easy to fix. It was also a little disappointing that the 4th lesson was extra long in terms of lectures and had no related assignments. The course was marked as completed when I finished the 3rd assignment so the fourth lesson was effectively optional.",3
11962,Interesting course! But the lecture videos are too long.,3
62226,The professor is excellent and presentation materials are very good. I gave only three stars because much of the course content is outdated by over 5 years and in some cases over 10 years!. This is unacceptable in a digital marketing college level course because the technology evolution cycle is getting shorter with each passing year and some of the case study examples are now obsolete.,3
66657,"The information, videos, links additional reading do provide important information. However this course is aimed at teachers and that is not clear from the title and much less with the small amount of articles that are related to teaching.

102033,the professor was a little bit dry and repetitive but otherwise the content was interesting!,3
3316,"This course is deceivingly full of content. If you want to get through this course you need to have a lot of time on your hands because of the shear amount of debugs your code will produce even if you follow the steps to the letter. So many things are taught over a 4 week period that if you do not do the extra reading to understand what is happening you will get an overview of angularjs, bower, gulp, grunt, yo, yeoman and so on without really knowing how to use any of these tools again. Also because of the number of interdependent parts to the application you create, when the professor decides to give you one of the html or js files again to do an assignment, chances are everything will break and you will spend a long time figuring out which variables' names have been changed and blabla...The professor does not give you a good basis for debugging your code, you need to modify the set up of gulp to show understandable stack traces to figure out what is going wrong.If you want a challenging course where you have to go the extra mile learning things from documentation and blogs to substitute the lack of detail in order to complete the course, than this is the course for you!I think this course needs to be restructured and the length increased to 6 weeks instead of 4, with more detailed content and understand of each tool and especially more on angularjs",3

The final project was considerably harder than the material taught in the class and problems with the course (e.g. the final exam file not being available) had obviously not been fixed since the last version of the course. A fell I now have a good basic understanding of python but not enough to do any real analysis. Fantastic course mentor/TA.",3
106283,"This course is a pretty good resource for full-time graduates who are doing research in Natural Language Processing, but not for other people who want to learn in part-time some concrete skills to resolve specific text mining problems.The course-style is heuristic-guiding based. Some questions are presented in lecturing or quiz, and answers are hardly found. So, some text books had better be specified.Homework of this course is quiz-based, only one optional programming task. It's easy to pass the course, but it's hard to master its content. As an application science area, more practical assignments should be provided, as can help students learn better.This is a 6-week open course teaching a complicated research area, Natural Language Processing, so most of its topic cannot be discussed in detail. However, this course could be designed and organized better.",3

I would have preferred more information on the ecosystem in which the critters dwelled. The Ancient Marine Reptile class did a much better job of presenting this info although it did some laundry listing.",3
15276,"The course was very limited, it should have been combined with Introduction to R.",3
94343,Compared to previous two courses in specialization this one is far worse - it is more of excursion into used methods than actual learning using any of mentioned methods in enough detail to be able to do meaningful analyses.,3
104927,Teaching material is very good. But I feel the Professor's explanation is monotonic and uses more of textual definitions rather than simple explanations which are required for starters.,3
90929,The course is awesome in terms of topics covered. But the pace is too fast. moreover the lectures are not comprehensive. It is needed to put more material or refer some notes or books that might help,3
22163,Good Course and Professor very clear. But a lot of content (40%) is for USA.,3
67044,"The course is super interesting. However, the lectures could be better explained and the material better organized. I found myself constantly looking online for extra material to better understand the concepts. Also, you can tell that the course is not anymore groomed and there are some mistakes in a quiz due to lack of care. In any case, the course is very recommendable to start with neural networks",3
32493,"Good course on Infectious diseases; rather broad which includes social and belief perspectives.Good points are: the part on the ""social networks"" which enable the student in better understanding on the patterns of transmission; the part on agriculture and zoonosis and their impact on infections in humans.Parts where I expected a bit more: the part on the ""dynamics"", mostly on the SIR framework (I actually I choose to take this course hoping to get a deeper and practical understanding of this type of modeling).",3

It would be better if the presentation material was bigger and the facilitator images smaller - you need only see a face, not the whole upper body in the foreground.Nevertheless, I have been enlightened !",3
98889,Not a very good course. The assignments are not very clear. Could have done much more like integrating front-end etc in place of that loopback module. Was really disappointed with this one. Should have given 0 stars but gave 3 stars for Jogesh Muppala as he is my favourite teacher when it comes to MOOC,3
50965,"Seemed like more of two week advertisement of the specialization and Agile, rather than a course. Some good information in the video lectures, but very heavy handed on the delivery.",3
68232,"I enjoyed the course and I will continue with the specialization. I am giving a 3-star rating as i) the lectures need to be updated with correct data or need to provide guidance as to when one should expect individual difference when following along with the notebook, ii) instructor / mentor response in the discussion forums is lacking, iii) graphlab is now an outdated tool as it is not commercially available.",3
12441,"The final assessment somewhat not really well designed, imho.",3
14476,"The first course is composed in articulate way that allows a simple and schematic way of comprehension, but some single parts of the first course seem to be lacking of some information, above all to me without previous experience in informatics tools like github.

21562,"The content of the course is good and I feel it would be beneficial for beginners or those who want to top up their technical / academic knowledge on the subject.I found the terrible editing of the lectures distracting though, and it felt like no one bothered to over-see the final version that was published. I also don't think the fact that one has to pay so much to access the assessments, which many other courses don't do at all, is conducive to creating a strong engagement in the course. I wouldn't for example be encouraged to take another course from this series (not sure if one is offered).",3
96933,"Five stars for the excellent teachers and content, but the course is not made for Coursera: very long videos, slides full of words, many references to the group work for the course at JHU, tiny quizzes and just two practical assignments. The format and the examinations can be definitely improved.",3
106475,I liked it!The only problem is a webcam that a lot of people do not have.,3
95132,"Honestly, it was a good crash course into data science in python. My 3/5 star rating comes from the fact that I think their could be more content / examples shown in the videos.

65,good introduction into the applications of 3D printing.,3
68506,"The course content is great. It gives overview on what is going to be learned in details in the next courses. Considering that it is an introductory course and the fact that it utilizes the GraphLab library as tool, I believe it is overpriced compared to the other courses of the specialization.",3
96367,This was a four star course and the links to additional information were a good resource. 3 stars for the discussions which were left unanswered much of the time and not a highly active mentor group. Much was left to student when stuck and exasperated options.,3
6442,"Course is mostly theoretical. So far it's difficult to say anything about its practical implications and usefulness. It's my first course on Coursera, so I can't compare. But I think sometimes it lacks a bit clarity, especially considering lecturer's English and bad quality of subtitles which sometimes do not match real lecturer's words. Anyway it was interesting and now I'm really intrigued about how I can apply this new knowledge to real everyday development tasks. Most probably I will try following courses in the specialization. Thanks a lot to authors!",3
60403,The course was very informative but the slides were a little boring. The content could have been more engaging. Sometimes the supplementary reading contained examples that could have been better explained in a video. I would have appreciate a more comprehensive explanation of content on slides using markers or pointers. Sometimes I did not know where I needed to focus. I hope the instructors create more videos for the same content. This is may be because I am more of a visual or an engaged learner.,3
88260,Capstone project methodology is a bit disappointing.The previous modules were great,3
20888,"I loved everything about the course content, but peer assessment is a TERRIBLE idea.For one submission I could get both the highest and the lowest grade, without any feedback. Any internet troll could have taken the course and graded participants with the lowest grades possible. Not fun.I have passed the course (89%), but I won't even try another peer assessment based course.It's such an irony that (aspiring) teachers were not able to assess someone else's work properly.",3
20279,Should have been a complete course. The course did not give specific tools to conflict resolution rather information about the subject was disseminated,3

90640,"good course, but need to pay for tests",3
33413,"While I was disappointed that HTML forms weren't discussed, this course provided very solid information. A lot of slide and code typos were distracting though and it felt like the instructor was talking less to me (and more reading from a hidden screen), which dampened the overall experience a bit. But the way the instructor explained the course material was very approachable and easy for a beginner like me to understand. After taking this course, I feel like I'm one step closer to thoroughly understanding HTML5.",3
18646,Really frustated with this course. Lacks of explanation on the javascript part. Don´t think is recommended for beginners.,3
85836,Great level of detail and information.,3
16869,"Interesting to try R hands on. Could have made more definitive statements on the usefulness of each test (there was lots of 'you could have a look at this analysis, or this one, or this one' without covering why each one would be particularly good for this case). Some of the later exercises also made quite of a leap in terms of what you were expected to know about R syntax, although the follow up answers were good if you didn't understand what was expected.",3
76260,This course is way too simple and too slow. Probably good for someone who has never done programming before.,3
90695,"would of liked to see more programming examples in the lectures. But all in all, fun course!",3
8392,"The course was very useful with what knowledge it provides. However, it would be better if there were more hands-on exercises on relevant stuff. The exercises are too easy and boring. Tougher exercises should be added and more time should be spent on the Hadoop Ecosystem part. Knowing the history helps but it should not replace more important topics.",3
9596,"Some of the contents just seem overly complex, especially the videos. If they would do a few problems similar to those in the quizzes, it would be much more better.",3
27913,"The last assignment caused me CONFUSION. I mean, due to the unclear assignment requirements, we cannot review composition for composition's sake. For example, I did use two squares as the assignment asked, but I changed the transparency of them, so they form a new square when overlapping. And people think I used three squares and thus not following the instructions. And many people used a small circle and a large circle putting at the center vertically to form a scale composition, and you have to give them 3 points because they followed the instructions, but they actually did not do much in terms of composition. Though I got 3.5 scores by two people ( not very bad）, I'm still frustrated, and I hope the assignment requirements could be clearer.",3
24433,good learning with explanation on basic financials,3
91811,A surface level look into creating a SQL database with Python. Skims over topics quickly and does not go into depth on how to write code effectively or build a database from scratch.,3
16387,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before.",3
86294,The content drags and can be boring,3
34973,Inappropriate rating was done for me.,3
96212,"I think this course was way too ambitious. It's neat to imagine learning all of this stuff in four weeks, but one should be realistic. Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the ""additional resources"". The lectures and scaffolded exercises certainly exposed us to a lot, but it would be hard to say I really learned very much.",3

12901,I wish that the videos were longer.,3
68344,"The course is effectively a tutorial on how to use proprietary software to solve a range of machine learning problems.I liked the fact that the course covered a wide range of problems quickly. There were however two issues that I did not like.1) It is not well supported and given that the technology is proprietary, there are few other places that offer support (i.e. you can’t just look at problems and solutions on stackoverflow to get insight into the tech)2) For a course labelled as “intermediate”, it presented very little detail. Most of the course was dedicated to explaining particular problems, the solution to which was inevitably “then you train this really clever, one-line algorithm we have written for you and you query it for insights”. I felt a little cheated by this approach to a subject which should be really fascinating.While some of my concerns may be addressed in follow on courses, I am left with little insight into what really lies ahead. For example, is this really an “intermediate” course? What background do I really need? Will we ever get to the detail or will I always just be expected to call someone else’s brilliant algorithm and accept the result.",3
13988,Good starter setup. Looking forward to the technical portion of the Specialization.,3
45345,"I liked it, but I felt like they didn't get very in depth about a lot of the topics. It was hard to take notes because there seemed to be a lot of skimming of subjects and jumping around.",3
62281,"The course was informative and engaging. However, the process of receiving peer reviews on exercises was extremely frustrating and detracted from my overall satisfaction with the course. Many people ignored the grading criteria and gave me a lower score than was warranted, despite having answered the question(s) fully, referencing lecture material and even including additional information sources (all of which was referenced with links). I know that I am not alone in this experience, as these types of comments come up frequently in the forum posts. Since there is no recourse for a poor grade other than to resubmit an exercise to a new cohort of peers and hope that they are more fairly critiqued, this grading process puts students at the mercy of peers who either do not understand or do not care about the instructions for grading each other's work.",3
25415,"It was a good course overall, but some of the material was very complex and would require more than 3 weeks of study. I am not sure whether it will be useful in a real life, especially calculating Chi-squared and such. I also wish the professor would simplify the language in which he speaks in the lectures.",3
4226,"Good Course, but final project asks a lot for what this course is",3
7608,"Very good place to start for beginners with some scientific information. Easy and quick to do food demonstrations, basic enough that students can build upon them depending on what is available at hand.Some ideas just tend to be redundant throughout the weeks, but I guess that is what she wants to stress on. No to processed food!! :)) I just wish you kept the discussion boards open, so we have a platform to discuss ideas and exchange recipes.",3
14905,"The course accomplished its goal. Nevertheless, since it is a paid course I expected to find more theoretical content",3
5680,"It was a good Mooc, but I think it should imply many more examples to be made by the own students along the course.

Good... but not as good as the previous.",3

98313,"This course provides a good overview about virtual instruction and online learning for those who are looking to transition from classroom teaching. The topics are broken down into manageable chunks and a few interviews with other people help to add interest. However, when I wanted to go back and reread for clarification, I found the transcript to be poorly edited and at times almost unintelligible. As an example: iNACOL (National Association for Online and Blended Learning) is referred to many times in the video lectures and was transcribed in the text in a number of different ways: ""Ian Nicole"", ""Inacles"" and ""iNickel."" I really wish the people who put this course together has taken the time to read and edit the transcripts of the video lectures. Many sentences were written without punctuation or contained misspelled words. (enrollment was spelled enrolment) Often I just wanted to read it the lecture, not hear the instructor's voice but found the written text to be less than clear. I also wish there had been a way to ask questions regarding the material, but unfortunately, there was not, not that I could find. Finally, some of the questions on the final quiz are confusing. For example, question #5 "" Which two of the following..."" and then in parentheses it says to check all that apply. I hope this feedback helps to point out some of the problems that hinder virtual instruction.",3

28337,It is good for beginners only,3
16875,"This module took me on an interesting journey with lots of twists and turns. While I love challenges and learning otherwise I wouldn't have taken this course. I'd like to suggest the following: mentor to assist students, review of codes I found lots of glitches, one quiz rather than two, cut back on timeframe. I'd like to give more stars but am being generous with 3 stars.",3
52372,I was expecting something more in depth for methods and functions on swift,3
51161,Repetitive and surprisingly dry course.,3
103556,"OK, but not really in-depth. Still has useful pointers, but they could be summarized on an A4 sheet.",3
18555,"it started off as being for beginners but after a while it was rushed and made it extremely difficult for beginners to keep up. Please dont just tell the student to go and write the code for something without giving a hint. Also, there were math mistakes in the course material that are easy to fix.",3
39252,"The video quality was so bad, can not see the code clearly. Please update the better video.",3
83182,"Good learning materials, however the assignments are designed for compute science students rather than professional software developers as the most important part of the assignments is not parallel code, but it is algorithms. Yes, there is parallel code in the code of the assignments, but it is mostly written and your task is to implement the algorithm using this existing parallel code, while in my opinion it should be the other way around - you should implement parallel code and algorithms code should be already provided for you.",3
68779,Decent course. Not very satisfied with the assignments as they are suited for graphlab,3
47359,"Good course, very education",3
11039,"While the lectures were good, this course had annoying issues, such as in-video questions asking us to refer to previously shown material (which isn't easy given the Coursera interface). A few assignment questions were also poorly formulated. The course would have really benefited from .pdf reference material, for review and elaboration of topics presented in lectures. At minimum, a list of relevant equations would have helped.The acoustics part of the content seemed somewhat sketchy and hand-wavy; the assumptions and limitations behind the rule-of-thumb equations and models presented weren't given much weight, so I wasn't able to get a good grasp of when they were relevant*. The electronics part was more reasonable, but still suffered from some over-simplification (for example, the model of guitar pickups didn't include magnetic hysteresis).All in all, the course was worth taking, but I think the material deserves more rigor.*All models are wrong. But some of them are useful.",3
81906,very easy,3
101349,"It was an interesting module, however, not sure how I will apply this in",3
72336,Clear but the content is a bit too simple. Need to include more real world scenario and application.,3

24384,"The lectures weren't always easy to follow but the quizzes were really useful as they meant it was necessary to understand the material. Definitely a useful course, I will be interested to see how it relates to the real world of derivatives pricing.",3

91561,Good Work,3
14212,Good overview. Helpful introduction to topics covered in the specialization.,3
25519,"This seemed like a somewhat outdated course but did have a lot of basic info for people who want to make a game but haven't given it much thought. I also found the quizzes and review options frustration due to poorly worded questions and rating choices, as well as the lack of a written feedback option besides comments. Some of the videos seem to kind of drag on a bit as well, but overall it was still helpful for developing my game despite feeling like I didn't gain much new information.",3
20199,Some of the terminology doesn't seem congruent with what we use in North America,3
94303,too easy,3
23188,This is all information I already have in my arsenal after researching health trends and learning more about how I should eat. I was hoping for something a little more detailed.,3
13895,"It's a good introductory course, but it's very basic and I feel that I paid a lot for a very basic experience. I do understand it is the first step in a full specialization but I think it can be more challenging.",3
7200,"This course offers very useful high level overview of concepts and ideas which make you feel confident in the long run. However, the course is extremely basic and does not go deep beyond the high level concepts. The hands on exercises are boring and do not engage students. The course needs to be improved to make it more useful for students. This course is not very worthy of the money.",3
19232,"Pretty good in overall, but there are a few points that could be improved:- The content is taught in a weird order and the difficulty doesn't increase steadily. For example, week 4 and 5 feel like they have been made separately and about the same subject, but week 5 goes further. The last video of week 5 is interesting, but it seems improvised...- There could be more examples, especially from modern music. John from week 5 uses examples from the Beatles, which is great, but he's the only one. Week 3 has pretty much no examples at all.- Suppplementary material and notes are uneven from week to week. Week 2, 4 and especially 5 have good summaries of the videos and examples, but week 3 almost only has links to wikipedia...- The final exam is VERY difficult. There are some crazy chords and rhythm to analyse and there are advanced questions on points which have been seen very quickly in the videos.I can't really compare since I new some of the content of the class, but I think it's weel made for beginners as well as for intermediate musicians. But you'll probably need to do a bit of research yourself if you want to be ready for the exam.",3
27464,"In my opinion, it gets too technical and it is not a self contained course at all. Neither it is a beginner course for game theory. If someone is looking to understand the real basics of it, should take the Univeristy of Tokyo course. Some lessons were really abstract and I ended up looking for information in other websites to understand it. Another thing... I suppose the three lecturers are incredible good in their respective fields, but in the teaching part, Some Shoham's lessons were like listening to a robot. M. O Jackson is pretty clear in his explanations altough too technical, and Leyton Brown has a very clear way to teach, but I honestly got lost many times in the final exercises.",3
65315,"Course provides a simple introduction to Ruby. Unlike some others, it requires you to install Ruby from scratch (no VM with preinstalled components) and the final assignment requires you to do a project from scratch as well (no template). This is good and provides a much more real learning experience than some courses. However the bad things are: the deadlines are way too strict; the lectures are way too long and seem to have an unclear structure; technical problems are frequent; a lot of stuff remains poorly explained.",3
78018,"The course is too simplistic in my opinion. The entire 7 week course should be condensed into the first week - a single one hour lesson.Still, I appreciate the time and effort of the course staff and thank them for providing the course.",3
82655,"Last week's content was thrown together from various bits & parts from the Functional Reactive Programming in Scala (or whatever the name of the predecessor of this course was).Overall, I felt that there was a lot of ground covered in a short amount of time - the course would have been better if it was longer, and week 4 material would have benefitted from being stretched into two or three weeks. Rather than reuse parts of the old course it would have been better to have new content purpose built for this course.",3
78728,"It is a very simple and smooth course for new comers, i think it would be better to have more challenging tasks and more related to a real world, that's why i've put 3 stars. Practise is everything, so good tasks are the essential part of learning process.",3
6523,"The course is supposed to be very informative. It is in fact. But after I spend hours raising my intellectual level trying to understand what they're talking about, I still have no idea what is the purpose of the meditation.Or rather I have it, but from another source, from a person who's been practicing it for 20 years. In 10 minutes I was given a crystal clear and logical answer on what is was all about. Unfortunately this course doesn't give this answer. It will rather improve your skill of understanding highly intellectual texts and will show you some interesting stuff about the brain.",3
86076,"Information was good, a bit dry at points and the presenter didn't seem that enthused to be presenting. Overall decent course on an important and relevant topic.",3
63708,Not really in debt treatment of the subject. Lacks realistic applications.,3
19047,"To be completely honest, I was expecting more from this course. One big setback is that the course material does not really go into biochemical fundamentals of what is going on, and instead jumps straight into algorithms. This might work for someone with enough background in biology who needs to learn to code. I, on the other side, have already had some exposure to software development and algorithms, but when Pavel mentions gene expression and transcription I have a very vague idea what he is talking about.",3
13779,So overly simple with a lack of details in the steps.,3
9977,"This is not a beginner's course unless you already have previous programming experience. The Python lessons are just samples taken from a completely different curriculum on Codecademy and poorly integrated into the bio-centric course content. The lessons are disjointed, taken out of context, and some of the examples are using the wrong version of Python and missing parentheses. It would be a lot better if they took the time to actually craft custom Python lessons designed specifically for this course instead of using ill-fitting lessons from other classes.",3
34646,"This is a motivational course, but it's not very extensive.",3
87406,It was a fun but some of the assignments required deep thinking.,3
68495,It is a very simple course.,3
17916,it could've given more instructions!,3
94414,"This course is great, instructor is good, however, the material of this course is not well organized, even the swirl practice is not put in the correct week, not in the same pace as the lectures. The quiz and project are far much easier than lecture content.",3
15095,"Course was good, nice introduction to data science and its branches. There was not much of depth.",3
12747,The audio quality of the lectures could be better. Assignments need to be challenging. Programming assignments in Assembly should be used to evaluate the grade in addition to quizzes.,3
11862,This course requires solid grounding in mathematics. No meant of Social Science graduates without proper training in statistics/mathematics. The course was good in the sense that we could how probability distributions are used to model real world problems.Study material was certainly not adequate.,3
92944,The assignment doesn't correspond with the content of classes closely.,3
13074,it was too much teory and not really data analytics tools.,3
34347,"Some good material overall, but the notes are not correctly formatted, tests are not formatted that well, lessons are not that clearly structured",3
22775,Simple and fast.Try to put more difficulty on the quizzes.,3
68664,"Having almost completed this course, I can say that this course provides a basic over view of the concepts of ML. Quality and content are lacking. The professors, breeze thru the concepts in few short videos. No further guidance is available. You are on your own.While the quizzes test the concepts learned, no live help is available. Again, you are on your own.1. Some course materials should be provided other than basic fancy power point slides. The lectures don't do justice to the material content and quizzes. Some reference materials or write ups would be greatly helpful.2. Teaching assistants or moderators should be made available for each course to help out with any conceptual or programmatic questions. Students are left to collaborate amongst themselves and figure out a solution. For a paid course, I expect some real professional help.Many a times, I had to turn to google to help me out if I was stuck at a problem or didnt understand a concept. If googling was the only option, then I do not see a value in this course.I doubt if I will continue the other courses in this specialization.Thanks!",3
79586,pretty cool course,3
61003,"I like the course and the material; I would suggest to include quiz, to the end of each section.As well, it will be easier to write a story from final task after each section, not at the very end",3
78515,"It was a bit too easy. But a good foundation for the ""Everybody"" audience.",3
97704,"It is a great theme, but at many points the course focuses on ""who said what"", regarding authors and papers, and emphasizes this type of question throughout all the tests. I think a longer course where these statements and papers could be properly discussed and explained would easily be a 5-star rating. The instructor clearly knows a lot on the subject and the material is top quality.",3
82662,Thoroughly enjoyed the lectures by M. Odersky! Unfortunately the lectures on Futures seemed a bit disconnected from the rest of the material...,3
17305,"Long, slow, rambling video. I watched most of it at 1.75x. Slides are kind of a mess and lectures are disorganized.",3
82692,"Learned quite a bit, but course was not as good as the first course of the specialization.Especially the presentations in week 4 are rather messy.",3
81899,"A nice introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.",3
94535,"good quick overview, could have more actual R examples in lectures",3
68531,"It's not a bad course, but it forces students to use GraphLab, a framework created by one the professors teaching the course, instead of using scikit-learn, a widely used framework for machine learning in Python.",3
24819,"While I enjoyed most of the content of this course, I felt that it was one long advertisement for Duetto. I will certainly continue the course series because I enjoy the learning. Also, a note for presenters, please be aware of how distracting so many hand gestures can be. Thanks!",3
34565,that's good,3
85752,Good content but the communication is not so great.,3
95500,Contents are great and very relative. Exam is fair and reasonable. However students have to deal with an autograder for the scores and the autograder is not up to par for this course. The amount of time that you spend on learning during the course is only a fraction of time you spend to get through the autograder.,3
40805,"This course remind me so much of course done by Wesleyan University - Social Psychology, by great profssor Scott Plous.",3
98320,"All in all I liked the course, it's easy to comprehend and well structured. Nevertheless, I missed the lecurer, I'd really liked that the lectured didn't read the script but retold it in the camera, it would be more of a face to face communication. Besides, some interviews would be nice.",3
20002,well!!it was interesting.,3
94375,more needs to be taught in class. what is taught is not sufficient for quizzes.,3
36544,"Content was great and Prof. Shiller is one of the most important economists of his generation. However, the assessments could have been better structured so as to be more challenging and a better diagnostic tool for learners. See the Wharton School Introduction to Corporate Accounting course for an example of well implemented multiple choice exams.",3
96235,The sound doesn't turn up very loud.,3
39251,"looks like it has great contents but really hard to finish it , due to video and audio issueIn some lectures , I can't hardly read the blurry syntax and almost impossible to hear",3
103092,"Interesting but not much of the science behind it was included, personal choice, but I prefer more why with my what. Good tools.",3
23051,This course had a lot of valuable information but in the quizzes it was only the most basic questions asked. And I would have liked more practice quizzes. Over all a good course though!,3
104873,"Covers a lot of info too fast! Some concepts are not clearly explained , had to surf online to get better understanding. Overall, fine course, very practical.",3
3690,"I liked pretty this course. I learnt some useful skills and tactics in order to develop a negotiation. As a negative point, I found lack of examples so that understand better the theoretical issues as well as to remember better.",3
17756,"Very basic level, nice talks though",3
70470,coordination is required between the lectures and the assignments so a to fill any gaps,3

42439,"A good starting point in Urban Infrastructures Management, but too theoretical.",3
63299,Good Course. Taught well. Should be free certificate. Thank you.,3
61708,"On scientific and philosophical reflections there are unbalanced focusing and biased approach to Enlightenment tradition of thoughts and Utilitarions views in particular, on the very contrary to what Prof. Shapiro explains in his MOOC ""Moral Foundations of Politics"".",3
86757,a little bit too easy for person who had basic knowledgement of python,3
101441,the lecturer is kind of boring,3
77275,It's easy to start python with this.,3
105669,"Professor was quite knowledgeable, and covered a breadth of topics. However, he often presented his political opinion as scientific fact. The quizzes/tests were also based on regurgitation of data/knowledge, rather than higher-order thinking such as application or synthesis",3
17361,"This is a cooked up version from an earlier, more extensive course. Lecture videos now split from 10-14 minutes into lots of 4-6 minute videos. It seems, some assignments are missing, too.",3
68653,"I did not have a lot of experience in machine learning, so this course was very good in the aspect of introducing people to machine learning concepts. Most of the times the material was very well explained, and I like the concept of the tutor writing on the screen at the same time they are presenting, personally it helps me more. Some of the quizzes were easy so you did not need a lot of preparation, some of them were more difficult or troublesome, like the quiz for Deep Learning. I also liked the graphlab module, I think that learning how to use it will help me with my own work.However, as this course does not really go in depth in the algorithms themselves, I feel that after one month and a half I have a basic idea, but I haven't learned much about how to implement machine learning on my own even in basic things, while other courses have more or less the same time frame and are more dense in their material. In my opinion, this whole introductory course would just be just splitted and each of these intrductory weeks would be appended as the first week of the subsequent modules to come. Because anyways, after 4 months in the specialization, if somebody continues to the recommender systems module for example, he/she would have forgotten the basics of this so they would need to cover again the recommender systems week in this course. And from the other hand, if some introduction is again repeated in the subsequent modules, then why have this introductory course anyways?Thanks.",3
27421,The course is very interesting and challenging but there are mistakes in the videos and too much mathematical theory with relation to examples.,3
845,"I wasn't sure what to expect with the Advanced Writing course. Again, peer review was unnecessarily harsh because people don't understand the flexibility and nuance of writing, but it's definitely informative and has made me a more mature academic writer. This specialization is well worth it, for the videos alone. The instructor is clear and the videos are very concise.",3
101154,It is OK but too broad to get actionable learnings,3
5093,2 Stars less because they should have included R video tutorials,3
102162,"Very informative, however a bit too detailed on the history of previous search engines and past Google updates. Could've done with a bit less history and more up to date information.",3
24528,"This course does a good job overall of framing the importance and challenges of working with big data, and certainly inspired me to want to learn more. However, I think the material could be organized better, and the lectures are not nearly the same quality as the universities' courses...not to mention too heavy on the PWC pitches. The quizzes and assignments don't necessarily correlate well with the lessons, and the assignments are structured poorly. Based on my experience, I would not recommend a PWC course to serious learners.",3
99721,"The course is well structured and Prof Muppala presents it in an interesting way. The range of technology covered was good and would be useful. The CapStone Project timelines are not realistic at all - one has to start implementing almost from the word go, the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and I think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course.",3
20216,"it's fine, not technical but ok",3
79433,"Relevant, to the point and natural presentations",3
94788,"knowledge-based, no skill-based work at all which is weird since the capstone is skills-based",3
103903,"Good introduction, it would be even better with a few more presentation on SWIFT.",3
31763,"The content is great, but the course lacks support from the staff. It is also too easy to pass. I hope the reason for this is because the course was introductory.",3
64190,"The course material was very interesting! The videos were a bit too lengthy, however.",3
61838,"A good course that could be better.I think that this course provided a reasonable introduction to Matplotlib, but the lectures need to go a bit deeper and provide more examples. The course left too much of the work to the student. [For your reference, I have a PhD in Mathematics, taught for several years at a highly selective undergraduate college, and have extensive experience in industry as a Matlab and SAS user.] The homework assignments were substantial, and I enjoyed doing the final assignment which required merging two or more datasets using Pandas and then Matplotlib to plot relationships. The course website provides estimates of the number of hours required to complete the assignments, but these were gross underestimates because so much about Matplotlib was left to the student. I would have preferred a bit more lecture time, more examples, and a few side tutorials on using Jupyter and notebooks (how to download and upload), especially since we were grading the code of our fellow students.",3
63614,The Good:Very palatable content and provides information at a very slow pace for ease of learning.More reasonable content and far more worthwhile than the first Arduino course of the series.The Bad:Not worth the money when looked at generally. The first and second course could easily have been merged. A lack of introduction to electronic circuits also hinders full use of what is being taught.,3
103713,"While informative I question the value of memorizing release years of os updates. Then again, it was an easy entry into the broader specialization. I think it is always a good thing to ease students in with a less challenging intro course much like a video game begins with an easy level and slowly gets harder.",3
311,"I liked it, although I felt like they were 2 courses: One for the first three weeks, another one during the last week.The ""First Course"" was OK, but it was regular accounting stuff. I was rusty on that so I enjoyed it.The ""Second Course"" was the one related with Analytics.I give it 3 Stars because you can see some lack of preparation in the team. And because didn't made a proper link between Accounting and Analytics.",3
17435,"Just as the Amy Bloom's course, this course has no descriptive arch and one is left to try and grasp the teaching points in a flood of reference material. Teach theory in a clear structure first please then provide reference. See Brando Skyhorse course, very structured.",3

68117,"I found the Course very interesting, well prepared from the Tutors and I liked the case study Approach since it provides actual examples where Machine Learning can be realized. I am interested to enroll in the second Course of the certificate to validate if it will go into more Details and Background regarding the build of the algorithms theoretically and in Python. I would like to thank both Tutor",3
88421,More matter should be covered in this course.,3
61837,"Pretty well structured class, but quite expensive considering very limited lectures and assignments that are mostly ""find your own challenge on the internet"".",3
89806,"While Professor Kaul's enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring, his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments. He often rambles through the material, spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand. When he decides to finally talk about the material, it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion. If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments, this course would not have been nearly as frustrating; challenging assignments, I agree, are crucial for learning the material well. I just wish I didn't have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open-ended questions.",3
7216,The level of the exercises and quizzes don't reflect the content of the course.,3
72221,"Apparently, the instructor is well-informed in the history of the band.Nevertheless, information is delivered in a huge portions, sometimes cluttered and it s easy to lost in the narrative.Sound quality is bad (the volume is jumping sometimes and there is a lot of noise)May I suggest that you provide a short arts of songs you are talking about?I understand, there are copyright issues, but still, something should be done about it.All in all, I wish to enroll in the second, improved release of this course",3

The videos give some perspective at the time of taking care of our own health and eating habits.The only problem I see, is the shortness of the course and the videos. The topics don't go beyond the surface and there is a lack of: details, examples, and comparisons between healthy diets and harmful ones.",3
102229,I wish if you could accept the submission of answers without upgrading to enroll for payment.,3
64499,"I rate this 3/5 because of how accurate it looks. I wish it was more practical and that gave some real explanations (not just ""this concept is called like this... because it is called like this""). As I said, anyway, it has a plethora of notions.",3
15310,Course content good but a little too basic in my eyes. I think the addition of more functions in SAS/Python would be useful. Having to do peer reviews is also not ideal.,3
102049,"Good introduction. But it feels like it is not complete. It is not much without the other courses so you either take the entire specialization or the benefits are not that big :(I feel like the specialization courses are an artificial break to a real university class... if the university class had only the content from those videos, that would not be enough.",3
65432,The course overall has good content. But some videos and case studies were dissapointing in terms of uniqueness of information. You could have easily googled it. Tests could also be more challenging. I would defitenely reccomend it to learners who are new to the industry. For others it could be less informative.,3
94038,"This course was a bit mediocre. The videos were often choppy, awkward, and cut off in the middle of sentences. The quiz questions were unclear and generally poorly written, and didn't make me think enough. I did enjoy the onboarding special topic section, and the quality was higher there.

88985,Good to follow by the subs,3
93374,"This course was mostly self learning. It gave me a framework to go along but what is presented in lecture and assignments are completely different. The discussion board and mentors are really good resources and can provide pointers to move along. It is definitely not a class that can provide sufficient information to learn and build applications, but the individual's effort in passing the quizzes and the projects will. It is up to the student to figure out through stack overflow, youtube, and other search result to figure out how to complete these assignments. I believe the assignments given from this class are realistic to real-world situations.",3
98612,"It is a great course, however some practical examples to try would benefit users",3

1310,"Even though there is a lot of useful information in this course, I personally don’t like it. I wouldn’t take this course again if I had a chance to go back in time.All hometasks are much more about programing in Java than algorithms. Open any week's discussion forum, you will find out that 90% questions and problems are about Java, not algorithms. If you are not a professional programer, you will spend at least 30-40 hours a weak instead of 6-10 hours.5 week’s task is just a pure joke: 30 minutes explanation about most difficult structure in the course and not a single line of code.. After that you must write it by yourself. Just look at week 5 discussion forum. Do you know why there are 42 topics in week 3 and only 7 in week 5? Because people decide not to do it.The goal of a teacher must be to make students love the course\matherial\science, not to hate it. I’m not sure about hating, but it was annoying as hell.",3
4537,good course,3
34321,"The course gives a very high level overview of hardware security and does not go into particular details. Understandably, hardware labs are not included in this online course and the only practice is basic boolean and modular algebra.Quality of the media and transcripts can be improved. Sound is very low and noisy in some videos which makes it hard to watch on a mobile device. Some videos seems to be cut of too early and week's 6 videos are out of order, which is annoying.Overall it's an okay overview of the topic for someone who is unlikely to apply it at daily job (e.g. software engineer like myself).",3
20298,This a basic course and covers the Collaborative style in some depth. The case studies are the clinchers. I would have loved to have more on the other styles as well.,3
83053,"The course was very interesting and thought-provoking. I found the introduction to probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and their properties struck a nice balance between intuition and formalism. The discussions highlighted exciting aspects of their power in simplifying complex problems involving uncertainty. However, I still do not feel I could propose convincing PGMs for real-world problems. There are examples in the course, but they are far removed from being concrete applications. I would have preferred there be an in depth analysis of an application of PGMs in the literature over the lengthy programming assignments. I am an experienced programmer with over 5 years of experience in many languages including MATLAB/Octave and I sometimes found it uninspiring to solve toy problems, not due to the difficulty in using the programming language, but rather because after the assignment had been completed I felt I had not really learnt much more than I would have from just watching the lectures, although, if you are interested in getting experience with MATLAB/Octave, the programming assignments are good practice. I qualify this in stating that I have not yet completed the next two courses on PGMs; this course may present an essential foundation that is necessary for the upcoming courses, and in any case provoked my interest in learning more about them",3
34624,"Not very motivational but nice,",3
13088,"While I appreciated the challenge of the capstone project, I didn't feel like the assignment's requests accurately aligned or represented what was provided in the lecture series. As someone who bought this course as one large pack (four courses, one capstone project), it would've been nice to see more intersection. I felt a little ""in the dark"" on some of this. Given the short timeline to finish the work, too, many of these requests need more time (e.g. building personas needs user research, ideally). All in all, a good challenge to a content professional, but don't expect all of this to align with what you learned in the lecture series.",3
15567,I expected much deeper knowledge for the course.,3
68552,"I think it was a good introductory course. However, I think it was too simple: assignments required no more than copy+paste from the lectures.I understand the primary goal is to hook people up on how good graphlabs is, but I'd rather leaarn numpy, sklearn and other widely available tools. At least show both in the leactures. Please :)",3

18706,"The peer-review assignment is not properly designed. From my own experience, colleagues tend to underestimate other people's projects. In addition, the peer-review had an extra/optional advanced component (analysing criminal patterns for a second city; comparing patterns across two cities), which I carried out but got no extra credit for. The extra work was not even part of the assignment classification -- there should be a bonus question for students who carry out the advanced part of the assignment!",3
77075,Fair course. Explanations are good and materials are solid.,3
6453,Thank you so much for the interesting course. My thesis in master was on Antibacterials and (and more subjects) I am much interested in Microbiology.

In addition, adverbs, prepositional phrases (like in the morning), other transitions (furthermore) could be used to create variety. At last, combining the short sentences, medium sentences (10-15 words) and long ones (20-40 words) will also make your writing alive. Some other tips will also help like repeating key nouns, using synonyms, saying things in different ways.- Use different sentence types- Start sentence differently- Use different sentence lengths- Use synonyms effectivelyConsidering sentence variety will be the last step when you revise your essay, so do not do it in the begining.",3

The class was challenging, but mostly for the wrong reasons.

It also took me much longer than the 4-8 hours per week advertised to complete each week.",3

It would be nice to have more practice with some of the different formats (e.g., JSON) and for exercises to loop back to some of the early content. I did like that the final exercise required a fair amount of investigation into understanding the documentation and relationship between the files before undertaking to code.",3
94948,"A lot of the practical materials in the courses are taught by the TAs, most of whom tend to speak in a monotonous manner and failed to teach at a pace that matches the difficulties or complexity of the content. There is no slowing down or speeding up for hard-to-grasp or easy materials. Also, it seems to me that they are delivering the lectures by reading line by line from a piece of paper.",3
36482,"Financial Markets provided good information on the landscape of finance, mostly referring to USA. If you're from elsewhere (Canada), this course would not really apply. Some of Robert Shiller's ideas were unclear or lost as he was not the best communicator but his passion for finance was evident. The guest speakers, although high profile, were not the best choices, also because of issues with public speaking and generally getting ideas across. I expected more math involved for a course like this but Shiller rather provided more of a historical account of finance. Overall, it is a course worth taking if you're looking for a good overview of finance, how the industry works and how it became that way.",3

42055,"I enjoyed this course but I was not satisfied with the assessment.The content kept me engaged and highly motivated. I acquired some very specific and useful skills, which I developed by completing projects on topics of my choosing that were meaningful to me. I really liked Karl's casual and somewhat spontaneous style - this is a breath of fresh air from the video tutorials out there where lecturers are reading from prompts or reciting from memory.The biggest drawback to this course is that it relied completely on peer grading for the assessment (which you have to pay for). I don't think this assessment method was sufficiently designed to reduce the influence of graders who were overly subjective, hadn't sufficiently mastered the content themselves, or were disinterested in putting effort into the peer review. From now on, I will think twice about paying for any course where all of the assessment is based on how my classmates grade me. While peer review can be useful for learning, I don't think it's an accurate assessment tool. Especially if I'm paying to learn from a professional in a field, I'd expect to receive some feedback and assessment from that pro.Another area of improvement is that there were several instances where videos repeated things covered in previous videos. These things could be cleaned up a bit and the course would be more polished.",3

One more thing, though at the beginning of the class, the professor notified that Beatles songs won't be played in the class due to copyright reason, but when students really go through the whole class, it is very hard to follow.

35978,"The course topics are great and I have to admit that I learned a lot during this course. The provided materials are good, but in my opinion sometimes not enough to be able to answer some of the questions in the tests. I had to spend some time researching the web to work out some of the problems. This per se is definitely not bad (it rather resembles real life), but all the other courses I have taken on Coursera and other platforms provide enough material and/or explanations to be able to work out all the problems without needing to look it up somewhere else.The problem-solving issue also has to do, to a certain extent, with the formulation both of some questions and answers, which in some cases can be understood in different ways because a key word is missing or is wrong, usually prepositions. I am aware of the fact that the course creators are not native English speakers, but, when formulating questions and answers, they should take the time to check their formulations for grammar and correctness (I am sure there would be no mistakes if the course were in French :) ).I posted a couple of questions on the forums and, sadly, never received an answer. Neither from fellow students, nor from the course moderators. Certainly the fellow students do not have any obligation to reply to questions, and I usually would say the course moderators don't either. But I am paying for this certificate and I therefore expect some kind of support. I am sure the course moderators are very busy and do not have time to be browsing around the question forums every day, but so am I. And taking a look in the forums once a week or so wouldn't hurt. Let me also point out, that the 2 questions I posted are THE ONLY questions in the forums, so it's not as if the moderators would be overwhelmed by the amount of questions posted. After my second question, I knew I was all by myself. From other courses I know that course moderators chime in once in a while on questions that have not been answered by fellow students and when no fellow student seems to be able to find or provide a correct answer.The course is good, and you will learn a lot. If it weren't for the lack of support in the forums, I would give it 4 or maybe even 5 stars, depending on the responses I would receive.Either way, enjoy the course!! I really did, even if it may not sound like it :)",3

35234,"About: First Lessons contain some Interface/Questionnaire errors.Hi, I reckon it's a tad too early to rate this course since it is only going to start - but I didn't see another option to contact the Course Administrator other than trough the rating process.When going through the introduction of this course, there were multiple errors in the Quizzes/Q&A's. EG: On a question with 1 correct answer, the solution page would also show the clearly wrong answers as ""correct"" (or ""correct, well done""). There were several examples like this. It was only a bit confusing at start (this is my very first course on Coursera, maybe it's common thing to happen.)There was also no option in these videos to thumb-up or -down vote, or to report a problem, like I had seen on other courses.In my opinion the videos were well spoken and easy to understand, and they included everything one could think of when first considering to start playing the guitar. Only the beginning of the first video had a slight feeling of ""Ok, I'm a bit annoyed to do this now"" but that could easily be a misinterpretation or a strategy to capture interest. ;-)I do believe it's a good thing that T. shows all the possible extra's one can buy for a guitar, half of which no guitar player I know owns and which, all together would cost almost as much a beginner guitar, but I believe he omitted that guitar strings generally live longer when you clean the strings with a cloth where you touched them after playing. That's a good maintenance practice if you cannot afford to buy 2 sets of strings every month.Maybe a good addition would be that guitars/instruments can also be rented for relatively cheap, instead of having to spend 500-1000 before even knowing what to look (listen) for when buying a guitar.To me the questions until now were a bit too easy but that's Ok. I might be studying with people half my age so that's fine. Especially the first questions should not be frightening but at least tickle your brain ""a little bit"" instead of just repeating a word from the video.Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to study with you (all) !Sincerely, Xavier Weydert",3
28048,"Overall I think this is a great course and really helpful. However, I had an unpleasant experience on the last week. There is an assignment that asks you to create a single contrast composition of 2 shapes. It says ""shapes"" and still people are not sure if they can use more count of those shapes. I chose to use 2 shapes, but multiple counts and some people that thought this is not only 2 shapes, but 2 counts as well, chose to grade my work with the lowest rating due to unfulfilled assignment. I think this is Coursera`s fault to begin with. They should word their requirements properly so it does not create confusion. Now, we are left to the good will of a classmate to judge our work and people are not even sure what the assignment asks of us exactly.",3

36895,"While this course is well organized and descriptive, it barely touches the Internet of Things technologies.",3
44670,Accessible introduction to basic learning techniques.,3
90149,The materials are not deep enough. And the programming assignments are just so-so.,3
30850,A good clear examination of basic punctuation and grammar. The lectures are well presented and the exercises useful. The element which really doesn't work is the peer assessment or review. This seems intended to replace forum discussions but it is not a good substitute (and there are no forums).,3
89048,"The course is interesting and its staff makes a great team, but I think as an introduction course, it should focus on the History of Philosophy, without entering into very specific fields of Modern Philosophy. The fundamental notions of Philosophy should be available for learners, as well as the great Philosophers from Ancient Greece to the Twentieth Century.",3
14467,concepts were very good but teaching method/material must improve...some of the materials and methods used are too unstable to be useful for professional use...more work should be done by instructors to separate the 'reliable' concepts/info from 'interesting to know but not ready for mass use',3
12152,"The content is good, but it's lacking articles, important bills etc..; and the quizzes aren't very hard",3
81185,"The course discussed a great deal of very important information, but the instruction was very rushed, and often lacked the specific details needed - for example, formulas were sometimes left out, and it was assumed you could/would just ""figure it out."" The quizzes were very detailed and specific - which I do not disagree with - but I feel as though they sometimes focused on minutiae rather than large or critical concepts.There were also several spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the quizzes.",3
82374,"Very concise contents, and a practical approach to Meteorjs",3
105119,"The course was more about CSR and philanthropy of businesses towards society which was not what I expected as the course topic as very vague. Having done an MBA in business I as expecting more in-depth teaching on strategies of various business and how their creation of value to stakeholders.The course is short and very appropriate for beginners but not in-depth knowledge, however it still does create valid points on businesses role towards society at large.Lastly I did like that all course material for all weeks were opened and thus one could progress through the course faster",3
61932,"Although the idea of this course is excellent, the reason I gave this course 2 stars is because of the logistical issues with the peer review process. SInce the idea was for participants to develop a project with ongoing editing based on peer feedback, this process is key. There were issues with accessing comments from peer reviewers and not enough submissions for me to complete all the required peer reviews. In the end, coursera staff were able to override the last bit so I could complete the course, but the experience was quite frustrating and disappointing. The other learners who I did have a chance to share work with were wonderful and thoughtful and several also expressed similar frustrations. This capstone course could be improved with the addition of supervisory staff/project mentors. Overall, however, the 4 course series was excellent.",3
88409,It is very good explained but it is just an small introduction about how to use the Raspberry Pi in a IoT framework.,3
105436,"For an undergraduate course it's good - my only comment is on delivery - quotations given verbally might have been better if shown on screen to drive them home.I hope the professor will do a military history course that analyzes war more particularly now that we have the broad strokes. My interest is piqued from this course and I want to know more about specific wars/battles. I am also interested in war prior to 1500, esp. ancient civilizations.",3
14504,The introduction of how to use github is undetailed in my opinion.,3
82726,"Was quite good but getting less and less useful, too abstract, lacking detail. Examples too academic, needs to be more practical.",3
101478,"Nice primer for modeling, but wish there were more workable problems to help hit the point home.",3
21879,good course. but some concepts are hard to understand for newbies. so felt it was a bit advanced in parts.,3
50815,I believe this introductory course would be better if it stresses more on the Agile Manifesto Part,3
24946,The links provided are informative.,3
6047,good overview of ARAF,3
104985,"This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization. I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available. Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums. I have seen most of the questions just being discussed among the students. A little disappointed. Will probably have to watch all the material again to have confidence with it.",3
90486,"Has interesting ideas and approach to forming a structure way of analysing a problem. The module does feel a little thin in content, and perhaps should be combined with Exploratory Analysis.",3
31332,Pretty basic stuff but you have to take it to advance to presumably more interesting material,3
20890,"If you are new to teaching ESL, this is probably not a good course. I found the homework used topics that a beginner would not be familiar with. I did like how they used various links to supplement the course (ie a chapter from a interesting text book) to help illustrate points in topics. I may retake the course after I have a foundation.",3
4505,"The whole course has very little about excel, rather about aweful a lot of data models. The course title is very misleading.",3
757,"Honestly, for something that says ""Advanced"" in the title, I thought it was a little too basic. There isn't enough depth and a lot of it involves common sense. Perhaps a more case-study driven course would have been interesting with more qualitative, essay responses required rather than cut-and-dry multiple-choice.",3
61036,Basic course and good for high school to undergraduates as the title suggest. Good for overview of managing your finance. Budgeting which is the cornerstone of managing money is well talked about.Very limited coverage on the investing portion and I disagree that intelligent speculation in the stock market is the way to educate individuals starting out on investment. I would prefer Dr Navarro teaching this topic and hearing his perspective on stock market. Asking people to cash out when a stock lose 10% is equivalent to selling low and buying high. A better question is has the business change when the stock price drops. A better read would be The intelligent investor.,3
99126,Needs improvement a lot I think.,3
82497,Content is good but honours assignments are unclear and no help from mentors in the discussion forums - more time-consuming than they should be,3
63744,Not as good as the former three in the Specialization. The BootStrap part could be better in my opinion.,3
65466,"This course has a very nice content. The difficult thing is to follow the classes with a very difficult language spoken by the teacher. Her English is not so good, although she has a good know-how about the subject but the classes are completely boring and apathetic. What a shame!",3
25126,Course project is difficult for someone who have little idea about the steps in pipelines. Could have included a video that explains few commonly used pipelines and ask the participants to do a project based on it.,3
10032,Good but not deep enough. It could be longer to cover more aspects or more profound.,3
80186,I would have liked better tools to do this type of work.,3
98066,"The course is very complete on it's subjects and points, but should have more slides and some times be more grafic about some examples, this makes the lessons boring and harder to follow because there is a massive amount of informations. Also have too much questions on the quizzes.",3
23600,"It was filled with a lot of interesting, pertinent information but I did feel that there was not enough variety in terms of interviews and I do wish that she had delved more into some of the topics. I understand it was an overview but I often felt that it was very brief.",3
81532,"Interesting subject, but I think it can delivered in more interactive ways. It fulls of conversation with the same setting. For instance, It will be more interesting if we put in different setting of conversation.",3
24833,"Too much information for a short amount of time to compile. I liked the questions in the middle of the videos, but I would be great to always have the justification of the answers for a more profund learnning.",3
60427,Content could have been boiled down to about 3 lectures. Most of it was common sense. The high level over view of the life cycle of data analysis projects was interesting and overall this was a good introduction to the field.,3
42391,"The 3 last weeks, excellent. But the two first to basic.",3
18501,javascript part is not covered in depth,3
20661,"Although the content was informational, the presenters were uninteresting and made watching the videos hard to do.",3
106901,Its intresting but often feels repetitive and more like advertising.,3
6879,Very interesting but too many informations on a short course,3
10096,"Probably because I'm new to all the big data and graph analytics terminologies but the lectures in this chapter were quite difficult to follow in my opinion. The instructor was just talking, not teaching nor explaining, just like someone who prepares notes and is reading to students. The hand-ons were a bit helpful, but overall this class is more for those who already know about the subject.",3
20252,"I wish there were another conflict specialization on Coursera to choose from.. one that is more modern, up to date, interesting, engaging, less patronizing .. etc. but there isn't. So I guess we're all stuck with this one. Need I say more.",3
88246,Grading rubric is too generic: If peers don't leave feedback then the student is left to draw assumptions from loosely-defined parameters.,3
90158,The first two assignments certainly tested knowledge of the subject however the last two assignmnets were lacking. Good course that does what it is supposed to do. More feedback from test cases would be very helpful.,3
95553,"Helpful, but the teacher is annoying and condesending.",3
89443,mechanically it worked pretty well. just a little hard to figger out what's going on and what's important. what needs to be memorized and what just needs to be understood . . .,3
32490,"Was an interesting course but, at least to me, seemed to lack relevant material I was hoping for. When Addressing the concepts of Ebola, SARS, or the concepts of anti-vaccination the content was vague. But overall I thought the course was very informative on the concepts of how infections can spread and how we can track the movements in order to help control infection rates. I will definitely be going back to rewatch some of these lectures in the future.",3
40967,Good introduction course. Perhaps a bit light on material... reviews from others are very helpful!,3
710,"Very tough, though very instructive.",3
81960,"As a learning course the final project was specification-less. they should ask for something specific and explained well they should test conecpts not asking for whatever idea you have, apply what you learned I think this is an old school method.",3
90380,More assignments would help reinforce learning,3
93352,"I really do not like the R language, I think it is sloppy and inconsistent. This class did ok teaching the basics of R, but it did not do anything toward teaching testing of R code (a key part of writing code!), best practices for modularization and factoring, and so on. In other words, it teaches you how to write R code that kind of works, but does not teach you how to write good code in R.",3
94403,Many things are not clear enough in multivariable regression part.,3
95996,"This course was more diverse than I thought it would be and I really enjoyed it, however I thought the end of year project could have provided more differentiated prep material as that confused me.",3
14167,"Pretty simple, the Univ of Michigan Data Science with Python set the bar pretty high.",3
21914,"The content of the course is good, but it seems abandoned - some links are outdated or don't work. I think it would be a much better experience for students if these first courses in the specialization got more love from the instructors.",3
95292,"I liked that the course was very assignment-oriented. It had a good structure and interesting additional readings. However, for people who are not familiar with pandas library it may be very challenging to pass assignments. This minimal guidance, I believe, results not in a better understanding, but in confused students writing bad code and spending hours not understanding online documentation. Overall, I really liked the idea and content of the course, but not how instructors approached the self-learning part.",3
17641,Good introductory course but a bit too superficial.,3
61577,The video lectures are not engaging at all.,3
104276,I am all for short videos but here it is a little bit too short... Tehchnically there is about 1h of videos for the 4 weeks of this course and no real documentations to review.Hence you get few pointers on how to design game wold for video games and really case studies in my opinion... A full review of one or two games would have been a great addition.,3
10962,"The professor does not evaluate your assignments. Your classmates do, giving you sometimes unfair qualifications. I won't continue with the rest of the course because of that. I think University of Washington or Coursera should have said this at the description of the course so people can decide better if take it or not.",3
32332,"It´s a very good course, but when we get to the part of really generating the app, I had a lot of problems that were not covered in the course.",3
12243,It is basic course with simple information,3
99775,Good course to hone time management skills!,3
93567,The course needs an update. Really poor presentation of the material although a lot of things are covered.,3
61132,"I'm not going to recommend this course strongly. I learned from it, not denying that. The reading materials were great. There are critical organization issues to learn. But there are two things I don't like. First, the assignment is not well designed. Article reflection is a convenient way to give an assignment but sometimes off the topics in the course notes. Other courses have along assignments but they are much better designed. Second, the instructor threw a lot of terminologies with much explanations. I don't think people would ever remember or use them correctly. Why bother using them?",3
15372,"The course is a very good introduction to Python for data exploration and management.That being said, it focuses too much on categorical data analysis, and I felt the transition to quantitative/continuous data was not very well done.Moreover, some more explanations about several Python functions or coding choices could be better explained.But it's encouraging to see this type of statistical course for Python and not R!! Again!",3
101353,It was theoretical but provided an apt understanding.,3
32353,"Quite comprehensive, entertaining course. Unfortunately, not being able to submit the assignments without paying a fee is rather offputting - Especially taking into account we're talking about peer-to-peer reviews",3
50714,This course is intended to tell about other courses but contains not so much useful information by itself.,3
67901,More theoretical. Analytical and Intuition is not much developed. Good for getting familiar with switch mode converter circuits.,3
4319,The order and content of the lessons wasn't planned with sufficient care.,3
103990,"Tedious introduction, delayed second week. Hope that the following section will be better.",3
72762,Course materials are well organized. It could be improved by adding more description.,3
22943,To simple with little examples,3
95280,"Skills acquired when finishing this first course are very useful and applicable. However, lectures and assignments are almost unrelated. This course is nothing for people who are new to python.",3
73574,"Fairly in-depth, but the lecture slides and examples have an antiquated feel and the testing involves very little other than simple recall (typically with examples already shown in the lecture slides). Evaluations should require more problem-solving and applying learned materials to new examples.",3
22693,It was a bit confusing to understand the topics and try to learn them by heart.,3
19227,"They just throw all the material at you without giving you enough explanations or exercises. This situation gets worse in the last two weeks and you can hardly breathe. It is like, ""Okay now we have learned that 1+2=3. Let's talk about calculus.""",3
11848,"It was little difficult to understand what the professor , but anyway it was good.",3
11647,"It accomplishes the main goal: help with the leap from C to C++, but:- It's damn slow. I had to use the 1.5x or 2x speed all the time, and I'm not native English.- The format of the slides is really ugly (e.g., those bullet points in the code)- No lecture notes are provided- The references are to his (expensive) books instead- No source code of examples is provided either- Graph theory is interesting, but out of scope. Waste of time for those who already know it are not interested in and just want to learn C++. It would be better to provide references for optional reading or reviewing.",3
55248,got better as I went along. The first few weeks were a little rough,3
73899,Easy MOOC for starters,3
99649,Good introduction,3
12078,Assignments would need to be improved...,3
98447,One must have some R knowledge prior to take this course. I would recommend to take the other R programming course from the Data Science track before.,3
99579,There were some useful examples in this course. But overall this course and the entire specialisation rely too heavily on Excel which seems a bit outdated when data sets are so much bigger these days (than the ones in this course). Based on the requirements of companies hiring data and business analysts the expectation for anybody who wants to work in this field is in at least one or more programming languages.,3
97341,Very Useful,3
11626,"This is a good course, but be sure you have a foundational level of understanding of Macroeconomics before starting - it doesn't provide a lot of background before diving into more advanced topics.",3
27329,I would prefer the lecture command line notes too in presentations or any other files in each week modules. It was difficult for me to understand her way of teaching and I felt the lectures didn't flow correctly.,3
15959,"The content was inconsistently delivered and the topics disorganized. The content was excellent, although a bit repetitive at the end.",3
1780,Very basic terms. Not very helpful for later concepts and would not recommend for business professionals that have experience,3
103673,Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,3
94066,The assignment is difficult,3
7455,"After taking a Nordic food diet course where they talked about children's' diets in the Nordic countries and how they were changing the norm, this course covered the basics as to what and why certain foods are good for you. I had been hoping for more complex recipes, but there were some differences to my dishes that I already make which were a nice change.",3
97049,It was an amazing experience,3
62946,"It was okay for an introduction to the methods, but I would have liked to learn about them in more details, i.e. the course was too short.",3
61818,This course was disappointing compared to the first course in the series (Introduction to Data Science). If you enjoy reading academic papers and peer reviews then this course is for you. If you don't then just search the web for tutorials on Matplotlib and Seaborn.,3
80641,Too much law for non lawyers,3
32520,"The exams did not explain why the wrong answers are wrong. Even after you succeed a test, I expect an explanation of the questions, and the correct answers. Even if I have a correct answer to a question, I don't know if my reasoning is correct..",3
2473,Not enough Tableau use for it to be in the title of the course,3
79872,"Useful if you want to take PMP exam, beginner info about PM, but not very deep.",3
41285,It's too diffult for some of the questions in the Quiz. Have no idea or support to solve them.,3
15206,The content is very basic. The whole course took my around 6 hours to finish. I think the instructor should add more solid training on GitHub.,3
81829,It was very interesting and quite simple to follow!Indicative for beginners!,3
29604,"It is a good course, but if you want to hand on the assignments, you have to pay. So I am a little disappointed.",3
13197,Would have rated it 4 if i had received my certificate of accomplishment like i was told at the starting of the course. The course was very informative and explained thoroughly and all but when you put it down on your resume or something its good to have a document backing up the claim.,3
90599,very minimal presentation of many concepts!,3
73467,There's a lot of material and it's hard to grasp it all. Hopefully that will improve as the course continues.,3
14315,"The course goes over the basic toolkit for data scientists. Overall it seemed too easy and maybe a bit simplistic. I was expecting more. There was a lot of optional reading made available in week 1, perhaps some optional assignments/quizzes related to that reading could be added to the course.",3
50754,Not so inpiring,3
15046,Good but needs more assistance with the students.,3
8804,Felt that it could have more writing exercises.,3
69875,"This course was in some ways a disappointment. Although the lectures were intriguing and clear, I felt like the assignments were essentially ""Go and pick up R on your own,"" which was pretty frustrating.",3
22043,"The selection of topics is great. However, the course is too abstract. I think some of the materials deserve to be discussed more comprehensively.",3
17398,It's not necessary for me,3
91436,Content is good. But more is there in Presentation that we have to self read. It would be better if somebody explains in video. Because reading we can do our-self and lots of content are available freely. But we spend money so that somebody teaches us those things.,3
14133,"A good intro to the tools, but for anyone with prior programming experience unnecessary",3
91869,There is not enough exercise.,3
30545,Very useful and the information taught are well presented,3
41009,"A quite simple beginning, might end up being a little bit too simple. The future looks promising, though!",3
50787,This course is very theory heavy. Not sure how memorizing concepts from the Agile manifesto will help in becoming a better product manager. I hope further courses are more application oriented.,3
33941,Very poor instructions and not enough theory.,3
82740,This course has some really good material but the way it has been presented is very disjointed and does not really do the job of properly illustrating Functional Program Design. Although topics such as Signal and FRP are interesting they serve little value in day to day use and assignments focusing on Futures would be far more beneficial.,3
90717,"The course is definitely has some value. At least it helps to feel the taste of quadrotor control. But there are some cons. 4 weeks is too short, and this entails fragmentation of course materials. A lot of reasonable questions are not answered and even not mentioned: we use Euler's angles, which lead to singularities and ambiguities, there are quaternions, but we'll not use it. Why? - no answer. PD gains tuning is manual. Is there any robust methods to build controls automatically? - no answer. And so on and so forth. And the last... lections are really boring, lector monotonically reads text, nevermind what - matrices, formulas, etc. He reads all of it in completely, with the same manner, without any interactivities with the slides. Actually it is realy demotivates. I guess one of students that made supplementary materials with marker will do much much better.Anyway, thanks for the course. I believe that highly motivated learner can get something new from it.",3
100270,Good course,3
91569,This a well paced class which does a good job of breaking down the fundamentals of project management cost accounting.,3
65259,very short course.,3
59664,"Poorly described, but versatile in coverage. Could do with accessing Lecture Notes.",3
22065,Awesome course! Intensive learning. I recommend a few studies of astronomy before take it.There are some issues with the feedback of others proffesors,3
83126,"Deep lectures, but exercises where more about complex problems than about parallel programing",3
62361,"This Course needs a Update, im really disappointed of Week 4 and the Assignments are Outdated and nothing new",3
25357,Video Orientation is not proper.,3
8469,"It's a good introduction, but more optional hadoop exercises can be added.",3
99872,Good information and advice. I wish it was more comprehensive though. It seemed to just give an overview of each topic discussed. More detail would have been nice.,3
11649,"Do this course for the assignments and to have something that keeps you on schedule. But be prepared to do your own research on topics.The professor goes off on pointless tangents forever. C is also supposed to be a prerequisite but then he ends also ends up explaining basic C (prefixing his explanation with you should know this). He then goes into these very specific, typical academic-style examples that he spends time talking about them (again pointless). And then very little time is left to explain the actual new C++ stuff, and he explains it assuming you kind-of know what he's talking about. So you'll have to stop the video and look up the topic online.",3
101837,"Very basic dive into social, feels like it was structured for an older audience.",3
91157,Mostly talking heads. Pretty good information. I'd like it faster. More dynamic talking heads could make this more watchable. Very generous of the World Bank to put this together.,3
69082,"lectures were well done, but the strong focus on using graphlab ruined this course for me",3
101736,"They do learn you about validation. But the spoken language is not that great and the steps are way to quick to do this in practice yourself. The help is also a bit shallow when doing the actual tasks. It's a good course if you want to learn about it and have a case as an example, not great if you want to simultaneously validate your own startup.",3
4341,Not so comfortable with using Excel.,3
95189,"In my humble opinion, the Python ramp-up in week 1 is not sufficient to effectively complete weeks 2-4. This course necessitates a bit more practice in Python. The lectures are cut-and-dry, and I recommend frequently referencing them when completing the assignments. I spent about 1.5x the listed time-to-complete on most assignments. On the flip side, I gained a lot of knowledge by putting forth full effort.",3
24730,"4/5 for content, 2/5 for presentation. Compared to other courses, the lecturer is slow and often reads from slides. Nevertheless thanks for the course.",3
61225,it is a little hard to student who not major in medicine,3
24558,I was expecting a lot more detail on ***how*** to perform data driven decision making. What I found is just a lot of buzzwords and very shallow overviews.,3
67154,"I have mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, scope is ambitious and getting to attend a course by G Hinton is a luxury. On the other hand, some topics are addressed confusingly (e.g. Hopfield Nets) or without going into much detail. But I think the worst of this course, and I wish Coursera would take care of that, is some quizzes being completely broken (missing or incorrect data), forcing you to go to Forums to get the correct question.There are big gaps of data and no course biography to follow or complete the missing gaps (lecture resources, when available, is just papers on the topic). Also, the course would benefit from better programming exercises... as it stands it is just ""download a program, complete a couple of methods, fill in the gaps on a quiz""",3
12212,"While the course materials themselves were very useful, the quizzes didn't feel like an effective test of the material and consisted of very few questions, which didn't leave room for error (especially problematic because some questions were subjective).",3
73322,It's really informative and helpful.I will definitely recommend it.,3
9874,i need android programming based course specially in xamrin / visual studio ........... i feel so much disappointment .,3
4173,WIsh there were more assignments. The final project was the only assignment in the course. Object-oriented programming in R requires more than a single assignment to grasp- even at a superficial level.,3
14283,There wasn't much to learn that I didn't already know. There was a lot of talk but no real practical application (I guess except for github for people that didn't know how to use that).,3
44966,<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>,3
79758,Not very proper explanation of How to use Control key with mouse to set button properties.No discussion forum,3
81417,Even though I liked how the teacher conducted her course in a dinamic way with 4 participants I expected more from this course.,3
8347,I'm not sure who the target audience is for this course. The level of presentation seems rudimentary to me. I had a hard time sustaining interest in the course and did not finish.,3
69020,Good course to begin machine learning with but it's too easy !!,3
93486,"The course lecture was ok, Swirl was pretty good. The assignment was confusing and the instructions were not very clear.",3
18948,"Just three stars for the topic chosen Grainger, a bit to complicated and sometimes not strait-forwarded tasks.",3
6040,The course is pretty good for a beginner.But it emphasis too much on using third party authoring tools and proper coding is not implemented.The required code is auto-generated and we as learners are only asked to make few changes on the already existing code.,3
70822,Not nearly as good as Part 1.,3
41240,"Good course with varied content and I very much liked the way it was build up (individual, business, cities, nations). Reason why I rated it 3 stars (only) is that the course was too easy - however I'm a sustainability professional. Maybe the word ""introduction"" can be taken into the title - as the course would serve as a good intro-course for practical application of sustainability.Geoffrey (The Netherlands)PS: the videos of the Parkers can be deleted from my point of view",3
34828,"Very well presented. Unfortunately I think the order was a bit strange. We focused on data analysis instead of basics of data generation. In an introductory course I would have liked to see a bit more what different data looks like. Vectors, rasters, etc.Some of us live and work in countries that don't have a lot of data (I'm a South African and I work in Malaysia... California, the Karroo, and Borneo have different amounts of information available). We're not learning GIS to analyse data because we don't have much data available. We're building the data...We spent too much time on rivers/watersheds. I get that hydrology is Nick's field but some us will work with cities, or population, or roads, planning farmlands - a bit of variety would be nice.The data should not be available off the Coursera page - we should have to get it off the internet so we get familiar with public data resources. The websites should have the broadest data - good regardless of what country you're in.",3
93232,not the easier way to learn R,3
18871,"Great course; only limited by the requirement for peers to review the assigned visualization to complete the course. Although I turned my assignment in well-ahead of the due date/time, I had to transfer to the following class because I could not get the required peer reviews (2) prior to the course closing, despite multiple requests in the discussion forum for assistance.",3
18450,"Material is relevant. Most of the assignments require student guesswork, writing functions not covered in the lecture.",3
50966,A bit 'light' on content but ok for an introduction.,3
83045,The audio is VERY VERY poor.That makes it very hard to understand what Prof Kohler is trying to impart on us..I often lost track,3
93867,The course videos are hard to follow. The Swirl package is good,3
17282,Good content for Data Scientists but video lessons are not sufficient to be able to complete the assignments. It required great deal of own searching and trials and errors to complete the course.,3
15106,Good overview of existing tools but more information will be useful to dig into the data world.,3
71896,"I definitely learned a few new things with this course but was hoping to learn some cutting edge tips on how to differentiate yourself as an artist with modern technology and how to build your fan-base online. It would be great to have tips on what to do on a day-to-day basis as an artist in the digital age. I also wish that the course covered more on how to avoid being ""shelved"" by a label or management company.",3
97589,Not updated data,3
93416,I give this course 3 star not 5 star because the level of programming assignments are bit difficult as compared to level discussed in lecture videos. Although lecture videos are very informative but beneficial only for very basic level programming and to solve these programming assignments lots of learning is needed.,3
52566,"In short, I am somewhat disappointed with the course overall. Of course both speakers have amazing experiences and that is valuable in itself but I do believe the structure of the lectures is not envolving as it should be. It seems that the basic rationale is being 'fired' in a not so much 'educative fashion'. Still there is much to learn from these contents.",3
557,"The topics are really interesting and advanced! However, there's a lot of talk in chinese, due to questions/answers from teacher and students, and the quizzes are a bit too easy. I learned a lot though.",3
31515,"This class is very easy. It is a decent introduction, but has very little content. It is clearly made to be accessible to people from all around the world, and takes the content very slowly. The test questions ask you to recite information from the video lectures and reading, rather than thinking critically. It seems like they are just trying to make sure you watched/read the content and understood it, rather than making sure you acquired the knowledge. I guess it would be hard to grade essay questions in a class this big, but the content could go a little faster.",3
2320,"The course satisfied me in various aspects. It is brief and clear. Thank you for our instructor for nice presentations.Nevertheless, I would expect more about pharma and treatment apporaches. More about drugs available in the markets and new trends.Psychotherapy applications / demonstrations would be very useful.",3
95734,"Great video, they should be longer and more detailed though.Some of the information about these topics were treated in a more detailed and useful way in the introductory course",3
11065,Wonderful lectures with heaps of useful information including video on blended teaching in action along with teacher interviews and enthusiastic presenters. The course is self-paced though so you are relying on your fellow learners being up to the point you are for peer assessment. Also some links don't work and there is little or no interaction from the Course leaders or TA's. The lectures are well worth it though.,3
42198,"I enjoyed the course overall, but the HR component/perspective was only somewhat useful. Beware of the final unit (week 4): the takeaways and the final quiz are not well aligned. In the week's final project, though the questions doesn't ask for them, be sure to explain your rationales. When reviewing your peers' work, the points rely on whether you've explained yourself. Cheri Alexander's inclusion of videos felt like filler and the notion of having to create a video as an assignment is time-consuming and ultimately not necessary to our learning. Because I experienced a great course with two of the three professors in Leading Teams, I can only conclude that Professor Alexander designed the final assignment, criteria, and quiz. These components were not clear. Fortunately, my classmates were very supportive and understood the spirit of the assignment. It's a good class, but I enjoyed the first one in this specialization more.",3
70283,I thought there will be deeper info.,3
1757,"The lectures are good and clear, with many concrete examples and exercices to train. The topic itself is a little limited, mostly to finance, whereas there would be so much more equally interesting diversity in data to analyse. I just don't dream of money all the time.The course limitations for free attendance get in the way of efficient learning though, using cheap tricks to manipulate you into buying, though I haven't seen these features used this way in other curses, I bet they're using what they teach to increase conversion using any way available.",3
60994,"The final assignment could use a little bit of work, from a clarity standpoint. I actually think that the exercise is quite rewarding, but the expectations of, and directions for participants aren't entirely clear (and that's coming from a native English speaker).",3
12955,I found the course interesting though the continual music being played in the background was a distraction for me and felt like a brainwashing exercise.,3
78132,"Easy to get in, now I know the basics of Python.. however, maybe too much extra stuff and discussion about this and that.",3
101120,"Even do the Research subject was very interesting, this capstone was a total disappointment.The Capstone did not offer very much support and the final review was performed for peers without previous knowledge and experience, receiving peer's complaints due to the fact that many got bad grading.Also, many peers complaint about the image of the Specialization Certificate for not being designed professionally and many felt that they petitions where overlook.",3
38447,"As a standard overview, the course is fine. However, the lecturer skirts around or hand waves away controversial or difficult subjects, and he's apparently afraid of offending anyone by getting too close to saying ""fuck"" or ""sex"" even in an academic setting. Additionally, this course won't introduce anyone to forgotten and erased artists of the past - women are largely absent from his history of rock, even though Janis Joplin and The Supremes didn't come out of nowhere. The quizzes are also too heavy on the trivia - ""who published what when"" questions rather than critical thinking questions about why or how.",3
100755,Interesting tha,3
63137,a good one for gaining more knowledge regarding managing people,3
19557,"This course is just AMAZING! I am a composer and I found myself astonished of how much I was lacking, yet, the quizzes translations, man, are so bad, must of the time those where ""Straight trough"" translations that are complete meaningless on Spanish, it's like they simply used Google translate. You might think ""it is not THAT bad"", well there are sections that ask you to determine stability based on the length of the line... good luck with that (Spanish usually takes more words to write the same idea)",3
18935,"It is ok, and not as good as the marketing class from warton",3
95962,This course is understanding water and sanitation through the lens of economics. Lacked water and sanitation element through infectious disease (biological lens). I guess that is why its water supply and sanitation POLICY.,3
27420,The examples are getting very abstract. It is getting difficult to understand the concepts with the examples explained.,3
61438,"For an introductory course it is ok, however can't help get the feeling that the material is just skimmed through. In an effort to structure each session in the same way, detail has been missed out. Practical examples and hands-on exercises are very inadequate. Not impressed.",3
34974,Nowhere near as useful as the first two courses. The assignment did not feel particularly relevant to the bulk of the course materials.,3
24691,"Good materials, but too long and drawn out.",3
31934,"Good, concise course.The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because I found it difficult (not impossible) to follow some of professor Eyal Naveh speach. His first language is not English, so I do not expect him to speak perfect English. However, I would expect the subtitles/transcript not to have basic mistakes. This became important when professor Naveb interview another person in Hebrew, as I found I could not really trust the subtitles.I think it wouldn't take much to make it an excellent course.My cheeky suggestion is to have a specialisation with The Emergence of the Modern Middle East by Professor Asher Susser as nucleus and a series of shorter, more in depth courses on certain of the bigger countries, such as Egypt, Turkey and Iran, similar to this one on Israel.",3
103575,visualized examples? - good content but lacked engagement,3
36238,The lectures were informative. This course is a must if one wants to understand the reasoning behind the creation of certain institutions and instruments. The quizzes were dull and basic stuff. They were just kept to test the attentiveness of the student during the lecture.,3
15346,Course material needs to updated to reflect current software updates.,3
14568,"As a software engineer I found this course a bit useless, but I do understand other people don't have the same background. Having said that, I believe it should be optional in the specialization.",3
57069,Too simple course. It may be nice for juniors.,3
8342,this course need some odifications because of cloudera version,3
93662,"I have some programming experience, but I often could not understand the questions being asked in the programming assignments. Not because of my skill level, but the lack of clarity in the directions. I felt that I learned a lot while taking this course because it held me accountable, but the course design could be much smoother.",3
88683,"Not as much practical as the other Python courses provided in this series. The coding assignment is quite easy, since the code has been already written, the ONLY thing you have to do is RUN IT...",3
27478,In my opinion issues aboard at course are too complex to explained in shorts terms.But the infomation was value enough for an overview approach.Thanks.,3
94669,Good teachers but a lot of questions in the quizzes were very ambiguous and unrelated to the Course Content.,3
10509,"It is a good short course to get an idea about Cloud Computing, Big Data and CDN.2 Points to the gentle instructor, Please try to elaborate more outside what is written in the slides. and the other point, please revise the Cloud Computing quiz as it focused on dates and history rather than focusing on the core of the subject.",3
98502,I found this course very useful and would recommend it to friends if they are interested,3
36627,Average Speakers and material,3
103362,"Skillful instructor, but terrible technical setup, and plenty of faults in the lecture slides in the videos. Also the audio-quality is poor.",3
101422,too easy. not enough practical skills or tools teaching,3
47681,"It is an interesting course, however, it focuses a bit too much on current students and test-taking. Learning is not something that stops after graduation and I would appreciate if the authors gave some attention to those who are already done with school, but do not want to stop acquiring new knowledge.",3
50035,"This course is not for absolute beginners. Even though I passed every exam and assignment, I found this course extremely difficult. I found myself having to rely on other lectures on python and book and internet blogs. This course is not a stand alone course as it if stated.I wish that there were more exercises where you could practice the lesson that was learned. I think each lesson should be accompanied by an optional exercise.",3
99025,Good homework and good examples.,3
27457,"The topic and the class content itself are good, but the introduction is too brief. Hope they can add more stuff!",3
103343,"The content is really an interesting topic that I'm sure a lot of learners with enjoy. However, the way it is presented needs a lot of work. First, the slides are not masterfully made; proper word count and transitions are not applied. Second, the length of the lessons are not conducive to learning, it needs to be trimmed to shorter lessons or even be cut. Third, it is repetitive and there's too much focus on the unnecessary, the lecture needs to be reviewed. Cracking the creativity code is an interesting topic. However, the lessons were not presented creatively enough.",3
90994,"Good course about NoSQL MongoDB. I learned a lot about the course but it would have been better if the instructor would have given some emphasis on programming with Unix machines like Macs. He used windows and in many cases I would run into problems like running Mongoid by including Gem files that he provided. I had to downgrade from rails 4 to 3 and then to 5, etc hitting StackOverflow every time to sort out technical issues.",3
73057,"Very interesting topic, but even for an introductory course not nearly enough to justify a full 4 week course for € 71!The first course, Fundamentals of Graphic Design, had more content, more (optional) assignments, and covered Typography, too.",3
82839,"Great topic, but the course was less interesting and profound than I expected. The professor could be a little more motivating. Worth the time though!",3
66448,Thanks for writing the new feature about the java8 for free.But for most lessons it is too easy to learn.,3
36010,Good general change management strategies as they relate to a complex health care environment,3
87562,Assignment Doings felt not that good as the courses before.,3
83984,"I really love the way Dr Chuck is teaching. It is incredibly clear and you never get bored even if each lecture is over 20 minutes long. After each lecture you do feel like you've become an expert in that topic.However, the course is very diluted.... Only 4-5 lectures over 7 weeks is too little content, especially if you are to pay the $79 required for certification. Each week contains a lot of videos that, although being interesting, are not directly relevant to the course. I finished the whole thing in 2 days ^^",3
93426,"I really struggled - coming from a zero programming background. I recommend tons of reading, practical exercises, swirl is a bit of a savior and so is stackoverflow. Even with all of that, I struggled to get my mind to think like a programmer and structure the thoughts into plans for the assignments and tests. I think there needs to be a course before this that teaches one what the first step of solving a programming-related problem; eg one that focuses on flow charts, breaking down the question, etc... It literally is like learning a new language : you need to keep reading and practicing and watching/listening to others do it until you start to get it.",3
79395,The course is good! But a little bit more on social media. It will be better if we can learn more about tactics and methods of personal branding.,3
9577,The lecturer was really great and was able to explain things enthusiastically and simply. Unfortunately I feel the level of the course is too low. I think the basis of calculus has to come from rigorous definitions of the concepts involved and firm understanding of the proofs. Hopefully I will get some of that in your Calculus Two course.,3
39372,"I would prefer to learn about less SMM tools more in depth, rather then getting to know so many just briefly. Felt a little bit overwhelmed.",3
25247,"The course is well structured and remains focused on the topic on hand. It is easy to follow Kevins thought, but the discussion is quite superficial; no concrete numbers and examples are worked through in the discussion. It would have strengthened the course if the discussion went step-by-step through a balance sheet of one of the companies featured in the course.",3
75832,good course. Can be better in terms of information and assignments.,3
62400,Good start to the course. Though I feel more energy and enthusiasm by the instructors would uplift the course. Some content is not prevalent at present (outdated).,3
34380,"Great Course, but much too fast paced",3
76738,"Very basic introduction. If you have any coding experience in other languages, this will be extremely simple.",3
100421,"It's look very very basics, i thought to get something more informative..",3
6565,"The faculty of this course represent a wonderful assembly of knowledge and experience. But the course was not well organized, and the emphasis on fine teaching that I have found in most Coursera courses was not present.",3
50518,"sir, could you pl. include some real time problems or natural phenomena while explaining a concept",3
79441,This course will be helpful for brands / people who begin their journey with personal branding and social media. The material contains many detailed personal examples and another great value of the course is in sharing experiences in the forums.,3
104869,"As someone who's new to the world of data science and doesn't have a university degree this course was very hard to get a good grasp on.That's partly the ""cause"" of how the course was taught which was assuming you had all the knowledge at hand of all the stuff Statistical Inference is about.For people that are starting this stuff it might be nice to have a introductory course of Statistical Inference as I did not finish this course by just watching the course video's and additional information, I had to look up additional resources which explained the material better.Still, a big thank you for explaining statistical inference and opening my eyes regarding this topic, it surely helped getting me to the next step in what Data Science is all about and makes it ever more interesting!",3
48711,"The course contains some interesting insights on writing a scientific paper. What I like about the course is that it is given by graduate students. But this is also a drawback. Sometimes, the material seems too simplistic.",3
62156,"In general I liked the course and content! However, some cases studies should be updated. The digital world changes dramatically fast and the course must follow it. We always expect to learn the latest trend and current examples.",3
19461,"If you have Oracle installed from previous classes, there is very little setup required. If not, give yourself ample time to install/configure it. Assignments take MUCH longer than the quoted 30 minutes.",3
100505,"course content was great, but I felt like the course left me hanging....",3
99987,"The topics are all very basic and the audio/video is sub-par, but the course offers a coherent overview of the core topics of time management and several useful tools and resources together with a few pointers to relevant literature on the topic, such as David Allen's GTD.Applying all of the techniques presented in the course is a surefire way to enhance one's own productivity both at work and in the private life.",3
61495,Great informative course,3
106819,"Kind of basic about the writing stuff, i wish it work more about audience and characteristics of each age. Very useful the second part of the course, about editing.",3
10184,Very complex and tedious subject.,3
92048,Nice course but didn't include enough python code for other database vendors and wasn't challenging enough,3
102076,need to be more advanced even for a beginner.,3
13,"Good content, but the course setting does (at least for me) not allow learn the content long term due to missing reading material.",3
10563,"Good course, I enjoyed learning chemistry! However, the pdf slides could be much better made, since most of them are empty, and the errors in the quiz should be corrected",3
89784,"The second week, by Wietse Tol, is simply brilliant. I learned a lot about the etic and emic perspective on depression, and his insights about sociocultural factors are amazing. On the other hand, the last two weeks are boring and dull: they take the typical psychiatric bias and simply ignore any research compromising their orthodoxy (for example, Kirsch's studies). It would be interesting to include, as well, critiques to the concept of depression as well: there are transdiagnostic approaches expanding quite quickly, besides classical critiques of DSM categories. Overall, I would focus on the first three weeks and ignore the rest.",3
67178,interesting history of neural networks and excellent coverage of all main architectures.couple of problems during the quizzes. An update is needed!,3

65457,"It gives a good idea about this market, although some of the ideas could be more systemized and clear",3
103996,"A resource if your starting with Swift. Video quality is often poor. Examples are a bit too contrived.

28386,"Very basic, but some things are useful, the course is worth it if you are a total newbie",3
72230,"I'm grateful to the professor for constructing and delivering this course. I learned a few things but the lack of musical analysis was a disappointment. I know that form is important but there was no mention of modulation, chord progressions or cadence styles (John versus Paul). I feel the course should have been titled The History of the Beatles.",3
61846,"The first course in this series was really good and this one was so-so at best. I got some skills out of it since I obsessively plotted everything and over did the assignments, but the peer grading rubrics are crap. It's all or nothing so if you submit *anything*, you get a grade (and it usually approaches 100%) but I didn't really get much helpful/thoughtful feedback on anything I did since you literally get ZERO feedback from the instructors (nothing!) nor did I get much in the way of helpful info from the people who peer reviewed my work. I find that pretty disappointing really.",3
82680,"Fantastic topic on itself, yet delivered in a rushed manner. Programming assignments are of uneven difficulty. The second assignment is all about a testing framework usage, not really aimed towards Functional Design at all. Feels like the material worth 10 weeks was crammed into 4 weeks.You can still learn some important conceptions, so it is not a total waste of your time.",3
83222,"The Course was fine. I would have rated it better if there were more practical examples, advice and real-life situations rather than so much theory.",3
18516,Hard to understand JS part.,3

8162,"Nice course about eating suggestions and good recipesIt could be useful giving details on how making a diet for children, with information about calories they need and so on",3
67558,"Overall a good and useful course, however:A) They could do a much better job regarding LDA, standard Gibbs sampling, and Bayesian model and inference. Many slides on these 3 topics only contained some text and the instructor tried to ""verbally"" visualize the related important concepts. Hence not a good use of a video session.B) Week 1 and the 1st half of Week 6 were redundant.C) It would be much better to have a 7-week course with more topics and may be with some optional videos on Bayesian model, HMM.",3
61839,"Seemed more introductory, here are the tools - go have fun rather than actually teaching teaching",3
93504,"It's okay, the explanations are mediocre as well as the assignments.",3
98649,It was quite hard with all the statistical jargon. Too much theory.,3
82891,"It was interesting and informative course. However, I found difficulty in relating lessons and get true meaning of the course",3
101631,"The selection of content is very good. Yet, the course requires solid amount of polishing. I had a feeling that the real teaching started only in the 4th week, with lots of walking around the subject in the beginning. Worth to mention that in contrast to the first 3 courses in Scala specialisation this one is very heavy on visual aspect. You actually have to see the picture, as the voice channel just references it.I can certainly recommend this course to people curious about data analysis. If you have had some experience and would like to try Spark or get better at it, then probably a good book can save your time.",3

31983,"Should have talked about how German and other European industries used forced labour for their benefit. Siemens is still involved in lawsuits about this and is on the news now.Please also talk about IBM's involvement in helping Nazi's with punch cards to help organise the millions of jews and other races they murderedArt theft is something thats really interesting that was not touched upon. THe german govt is now providing subsidies to art owners who wish to examine the provenance of the art they own so that it can be returned to the heirs of the rightful ownersInvolvement of Swiss (while being neutral) in banking and financial support to Nazis and exploitation of Jews is something that missing here. Numbered accounts were created to help jews send their money abroad without being detected, but their heirs could never get the money back",3
95503,"A good introduction to python and data science. The questions were just about the right level of difficulty. My main criticism is that the online videos were pretty short and not going into a lot of detail, whereas with the questions you had to do a lot of extra research to figure out how to solve them. More interaction with the enrolled students during the course and having more in-depth videos would make the course a lot better.",3
22883,This course was quick and simple. I enjoyed the definitions and monetary examples. I would have more quizzes and harder questions.,3

90504,"Too expensive for the material it provides; it is helpful and necessary but this course can be summarised in 1-2 lectures. There is a very good lecture from an external speaker,which was very good and funny (at least i found it funny) and i didn't realise that it was 30 mins long.",3
19641,"I cannot say much about the content, as I`m not a native speaker and can`t really decide about the quality of the language used.I really appreciate that we have the possibility to join online-classes but this courses made me have mixed feelings.1) I missed a proper Introduction - even tho Week 1 had a brief Introduction, I felt from the beginning like I was thrown in thr middle of a class starting somehwere2) The animated clips are quite nice, but the power point presentations were really old-fashioned. I think it might look more professional if there`d be a modern design as well.3) The teachers are quite difficult to rate. But I actually felt like in point one, even tho I was listening and understand what they were talking about, I didn`t felt related to any certain situation or example. Again, I felt like joining a class in the middle of the course.4) Writing some words big, some words small. In Titles/Headlines I understand that, but why do they write words like ""Negative or Highly Sensitive"" big within a text or in another text ""negative or highly sensitive"" ? There are no things like nouns in english most of the times, so why? That doesn`t look really professional to me.5) Lessons mentioned that didn`t seem to happen, like in week 2 or week 3 they referred to a previous lesson which never happend?6) Paying for the Quiz. I understand I joined the free audit and I`m really thankful to have access to all the material. But reviewing a quiz without paying would be useful even for people who don`t pay. As I`d love to know which things I did correct or which words I could use instead.",3

23591,"Good ""basics"" course. Great for beginners and reminders!I was hoping for something more advanced & was a bit disappointed. I am probably more knowledgeable than most however. The statement made regarding ""eating fruits & veggies regardless of whether they have pesticides or not"" was a bit tough for me as I became ill in part due to pesticides and still am. I might always be. I understand eating veggies in place of other foods (i. e. - processed foods) as I eat very little meat anymore.

To improve specially content organization: firt week is very heavy comparing with the others. The first and the last videos of the course, in Starbucks, in a very windy day, they have a very bad audio. The fourth week exam doesn't offers the pdf of the results. In final exam results they say 3,8 is 45% of 15,3 ¿?... Anyway, I expect more quality in the next course of the program ""Managing people""...",3
17067,"I was somewhat disappointed in this course as I expected much more ""practice"". The assignments did not have you actually perform any analytics activities. The course materials seem very out of date considering how much things change in the digital age.

99668,"Many errors in the quizzes made this course a disaster, although the course staff was eager to correct them as more complains in the discussions arrived.

93646,"1) This course is NOT for beginners in R programming. Huge gap between lectures and assignments. Swirl lessons are cool, but anyway they don't explain enough.2) I understand that studying is not always a joy, but lectures of this course are boring. First, slides come with brief comments of instructor. And second, it seems like the instructor speaks with no preparation as there are a lot of stammers, tongue slips, ""sort of"", ""kind of"" etc. It annoys a lot...",3
94209,"While the overview of the content seemed very reasonable both in scope and pacing, the lack of swirl exercises meant that the final project for the course was a bit jostling.

I did have learned something new but I'm not yet sure if it's useful or not. Guest speakers invited to this course do share some valuable ideas. For the main instructor, he's speaking really slow which can make you feel bored. However, it's reasonable when there is a big and varied audience on coursera because not everyone can hear a quick speech. I'm going to continue studying the course.",3

Unfortunately, the student role is pretty passive: you'll just look the teacher at work, you'll not build a site in this course. I skipped much of those lessons.

Should be amplified with additional weeks of topics, e.g. on Spark Streaming, etc.The Grader often returns opaque errors (""The Grader Failed""), when the actual problem was that the program ran out of memory or out of disk space. Grader can reject solutions, e.g. on the last assignment, if the programmer uses a different rounder implementation that returns subtly-different results, though the results print out as the same to the rounded degree of precision.The Grader should be written to accept results that are ""acceptably close"" to the desired result, e.g. if the desired result is 34.1, to accept perhaps numbers between 34.099 and 34.101 -- perhaps consult with other course-runners for best practices here.It might be helpful if the course provided a quick intro to running the assignments on DataBricks.Good first effort.",3

70618,The course is very good explained. However the practice relies a lot in code that cannot be explained like applets or mapping components... Sometimes you need more time to go through the documentation of a graphic library that you will never use again than in doing the actual assignment's core thing.,3
92634,It's clear and offers a very good foundation. Supplementary material is helpful. However in my view the course needs more practical illustrations of how some of the different strategy definition and approaches are practised (or not) today by modern-day companies. Some of the material was too abstract and was somewhat difficult to relate to.,3

94151,"Good frameworks that make a foundation. This course makes me realize selling is a critical skill. And Craig has done a great job at demystifying it. However, a lot of it is writing your own tool kits, assuming you already have successful sales experience. But that's what I realize I lack and that motivates me to take the course from the first place. If I had the right sales approach, then I would have been super successful already. Therefore, I would like to see more real examples that delve into the complexities of real-world selling situations. Also, Craig has an awesome personality: super high energy, very eager to engage; this makes me wonder the extent to which one's personality determines the effectiveness of the selling process. I, for one, am more of an introvert; so this begs the question if the introverts will need to do something differently to be as effective as the extroverts such as Craig. So, I encourage showcasing different approaches from already experienced salespeople from a wide range of personalities. In sum, I encourage the faculty to take this course to the next level by incorporating situational cases and how sales people of a wide range of personalities have handled difficult sales situations successfully, and/or how someone else have handled them unsuccessfully.",3

With regard to the 'peace process', we were informed that one of the major problems with 'peace negotiations' between Israel and the Palestinians was the 1948 issue, yet Rabin was clearly murdered because it was thought he would return land occupied in 1967 - so your analysis doesn't quite add up. As right wing and religious extremism in Israel and amongst the settlers has clearly worsened since Rabin's death it would have been appropriate to explained how it is now possible with a two state solution, and how todays level of extremism is likely to affect Israel itself.",3

14102,This course didn't teach me much about Data Science or the different areas to pursue after this introductory course. I probably could have got as much out of it as following the tutorials on GitHub and the new desktop tool. Following the tutorial which was made for windows was also a bit annoying at times. Finally I had to wait weeks to have my assignment marked and there is still conflicting information on the course page - in 'grades' it shows I didn't pass the week 4 task. On other pages it shows I did and earned 41 out of 41 points. However I can't see a confirmation of course completion.,3

91759,not too many new things about Python. mostly introduction to Python capabilities in databases/overall pretty good class.,3
29478,I very much enjoyed the information contained in the course - however I did find that it was difficult to apply some of the very nuanced biases to the financial problems posed in the quiz when many of the biases were used in examples outside of the stock market in the course readings leading up to the quiz. I really wish there were more examples for each bias (and more from the world of finance) because some biases were really hard to distinguish from one another. On one hand I did like that I wasn't spoon fed the information for the quizes but on the other I don't feel as though I was fully equipped to answer some of the quiz questions due to the way the information had been presented.The information built on itself so I found myself going back to week 1 information and week 2 information in week three.,3
643,I knew nothing about Jefferson before this course and nothing about his 'age' - not sure I am much the wiser about the latter after it! I enjoyed the tours round the historic sites and I thought the lecturer came over as warm and enthusiastic but it seemed he was preaching about a saint rather than giving a detached academic assessment of a historical figure and I found that it was hard to see the wood for the trees at times. Hagiographic might be an unkind description but it was certainly very respectful to the great man. I also liked the use of a student in cooperation with the lecturer.- he set the scene well and was a good interviewer.,3

I felt that someone was giving me the right answer for everything and I wasn't supposed to think about it all.I would rather focus my attention on the large gap between reality and ""scientific"" claims. The power of a cost-benefit analysis is enormous and it could be even broader with a personal interpretation and with a high level of awareness.Well done with the aim of the course, just develop the approach impact.p.s the part with the guy that is apparently in Asia is really chaotic and I couldn't follow that amount of short videos.",3

8391,There should be some reading material to assist learning. The course was too expensive for the small content it provided,3
82673,Week 3 assigment had little relationship with the material presented in the course. Week 4 needs quite a lot of polish...,3
61785,"very compressive , not long enough and still there is many info i didn't get !! :(but thnx any way for ur effort :D",3
24932,This course is super fast for beginner and i colder find the pause button. Great info but could've been delivered better.,3
21283,"Good course overall. There tends to be many lectures that are just lists of commands. Also, they don't seem to be updating the material. Many lectures are several years old and still have typos in them.",3
34303,"Good organization and lecture format, but stressfully strict rubrics on the assignments given the peer review structure.",3
25523,"The quizzes were too short to be effective, and without requiring written feedback from peer review, the process doesn't seem very useful. The best information was from the articles and books he recommends.",3
29881,This Course presented some valuable insight into what the public are urged to believe on this controversial epidemic...,3
97243,The course is comprehensive and the instructors have good teaching skills.The level is introductory.I would recommend this course to beginners with limited previous exposure to investment management.,3
42395,"Not as inspiring as Developing Innovative Ideas, but yet a very informative Course. I only audited the course.",3
90174,"The material is interesting, however there is not enough information provided by the course to effectively implement the algorithms in the allotted time of each week's assignments. It relies on deferring to external reading materials as primary sources, and these resources were not specified in advance to secure copies in a timely manner.Additionally, there is a big disconnect between the knowledge provided by the weekly material and what is required to easily do the programming assignments in the suggested time of 3 hours.Overall the course material needs to provide more background material to be more effective in delivering the knowledge expected each week. This may be an artifact of trying to cram what other online course provide in 7-10 weeks down into 4 weeks. If the intention is to give a ""flavor"" in 4 weeks, then the material needs to be distilled down into more of a cookbook format.",3
35043,I expected something a little more faced paced from Berklee. But it was still good.,3
79180,This is good for new born managers,3
4183,"This course has a very clear goal. However, the implementation of this goal needs significant improvement. The first three modules were very easy to master. However, the last module was disproportionately difficult, making it unreasonable for learners.",3
5882,"The problem sets are great and probably worth the price, but the lectures become very hard to follow after week 3 and the discussion forums are very disorganized - it's hard to find useful information. Some of the lectures have slides available, some don't; some of the lectures have somewhat-useful subtitles/transcripts, others have incomprehensible garbled messes (I don't know if they're machine-generated or just transcribed by someone with no understanding of the material/vocabulary - logarithm != algorithm!).I really like the problem sets, but some of the lectures are pretty rough, just a guy talking in front of some pseudocode for 10 minutes. The instructors seem friendly and engaging, though.",3
97791,"Appreciate this course a lot, it was crisp and to the point. Major focus was on using Design Thinking tool.The only downside was the lack of reference material. Course should include the slides that were presented in the video as well as some additional reading material (available for free)",3
72487,The course lacks deep theoretical understanding of the concepts.,3
36836,Not much useful if you want to learn about IOT but helpful if you want to learn historical development that lead to IOT,3
68172,"If you are already familiar with ML you won't learn anything new. The deep learning part is new, but it too short and lacks detail. I believe the concepts are explained in a clear manner but they are too high-level to be considered ""learning"". By the end of the course you will be familiar with some concepts of ML and the Graphlab API, but you won't be ready to implement anything by your own. However, I think this course is good to evaluate whether you like the teaching style and the overall style of the specialization. It would be nice to be able to skip this course and still get the specialization completed. if you already know what you want to learn and you don't want the the full specialization certificate jump into the other courses right away. I will continue with the specialization with the hope in the next courses the topics are covered in higher detail.",3
12768,"It teaches an interesting topic, but it's a bit hard to follow the teacher. I learnt from the exercises, mostly.",3
100984,Its a very small and easy course,3
16570,"Generally, a fair intro to key topics in ""Cybersecurity and Mobility"", however some of the sources are dated (and could be updated), given the fast-paced nature of the field. Still, worth some time if you want to learn more about where current trends are heading.",3
63725,"I think this course is missing some key elements for a complete beginner. I would suggest to expand on Bootstrap and how to work with it. For example, what do I do with the bootstarp files I have downloaded, where do they go, how to find their classes etc.",3
99681,It seems to me like the course could have like 2 or 3 times more video concerning tasks required,3
31856,"This class felt a bit elementary . . . but it had some good material as well. I would appreciate a bit less overacting and goofiness (which actually praised in the course) and have a bit more academic material. In one of the videos, the professor suggested that teaching should be slightly above the student's level but not too high. This course seemed to be a bit lower than my level (but I have taken education courses in the past).",3
42172,"I think participation in the forum discussion in this course seems not so active and less of interaction among students. If there are some incentives or some grading can be applied to push people to talk more, it will be a very good learning experience to all.",3
61277,for me too much graded questions - but in generall the course is good,3
8396,The course is a lot about talking and theory which is not very interesting. Final part of course is trying to work with hadoop using virtualbox and provided virtual image.,3
4476,"This course is good, but I feel it's too difficult. It would be good to suggest 'optional' prerequisite course if there is any. Thanks Dr. Egger.",3
94493,"The course is good. Unlike the previous courses I took in this track, there was almost no interaction in the forums and also no-one to give feedback. I wonder if there were any TA's present in this run.",3
69775,"For the amount of money one is paying for this product, one would at least expect teacher-student interaction. The tests are too easy, one can't learn properly from them.",3
3437,"Although a good introduction course, sometime is focus on javascript tools rather than on AngularJS itself which, in hand, looses time and doesn't explain/give examples on how to create directives and filters, which are two core functionalities of this framework.",3
51761,"Less is more. Not always, but it would be in this case. A lot of the lectures are unwatchable for me.",3
33608,"If you are looking a general HTML Course, this is for you. This provide general knowledge to create simple web pages, some basic HTML tags and a few practices. My expectation was to have a deeper knowledge of HTML5, spend more time reviewing difference between HTML5 version and the last ones but, I didn't get it, this why I'm giving just 3 starts",3
61610,"The course structure is okay and availability of course material e-book is big plus for the course.However there are negatives also.This is a course on ""Digital Marketing"" and it has to be taken to great heights in terms of content and delivery.Most critical issue is delivery. The most happening and lively subject like this needs a delivery in a exalted method. Though reference material is good collection but there is total disconnect between video lectures and those reference material at many instances.Revamp all video series. Add more case studies videos.",3
18637,"Introduced me to some cool ideas, web services and ideas for basic web design but isn't really a beginner course. I've switched over to a similar course from University of London.The lecturers in this course were very stiff and scripted and not overly simplistic in their explanations- something essential to avoid frustrating those of us just starting out. If you want a course that teaches you the basics from the true beginning but doesn't make you feel like you're an idiot for not understanding try Responsive Website Basics from the U of London & Goldsmiths.",3
48941,"A bit too commercial. Promise the cure for finding a job , but what did you learn ? This course might help you on awareness on your own abilities.",3
13711,"Nice, informative, but basic and short.",3
14309,"Quite basic - but good overview of general theory. Don't do this on its own, it's quite useless as a standalone module",3
57800,"At later stages also , examples should be used for explanation !",3
51772,Some of the videos weren't as clear as the previous course's videos. I suggest less gimmicks and more focus on learning the history. I will admit there were times I was lost on the quizzes because the videos weren't clear enough.,3
51674,"The course is thorough and well-explained, but the tests' questions and answers are absurdly badly-designed so they become very difficult.",3
63690,Course contents are fine.Unfortunately the absence of a course board where students can discuss and eventually receive help from the teacher has an bad influence on the course overall rating,3
98126,"Interessant, but it wasn't organized too well. Some questions referred to topics which came in the next lesson",3
80081,"I like the materials, but I don't like that you need to pay to take the quizzes. I think that it is against the spirit of Coursera because it limits the experience of user who are willing to learn but don't have enough money to pay for the course. Many other courses allow you to take quizzes and do projects whitout paying",3
12915,The course content does not follow the exam question is totally different what you learn from the two-minute video. You need to have the background in the field. This course should have gone through the beta test before release to the public.,3
39521,Very basic and the guy in the video was just reading out things on slides which made it boring,3
18643,its very good for beginners.,3
93130,It is not a beginner friendly course. Learn R from somewhere else and then take this course.,3
95031,Lectures are too fast!,3
91287,nice course at least to start with,3
15742,"The course information was great and the assignments were very helpful. What lost points for the course was not the content provided by Wesleyan, which was good, but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques. For each assignment I had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing, sometimes more. There should be a way to rate critiques so that students can't move on if they don't do the work of critiquing well.",3
104766,Learnt many new things. It was good.,3
7180,IMHO it's better to reduce the scope but provide more details of key technologies. Final assignment is not well explained.,3
53063,"Some few interesting insights on epistemology, but nothing more",3
1017,good in depth knowedge.,3
19378,"I liked the course very much, it could focus more on teaching metods during the assigments, but still give us a good material, tips and resourses to engage teaching practices.",3
51132,"In general this was an easy, interesting and enjoyable course, Video interviews and lectures by key researchers in this exciting field were a highlight. It's an introductory course so not deep, but fun.A couple of things significantly detracted from the course for me.One was a feeling of unqualified evangelism. I think the microbiome is indeed a hugely important field, but the level of hype here, and lack of any critical perspective, was off-putting. This is particularly disturbing for products like probiotics, which have become a huge industry with little solid evidence to support them, or to choose between them. Also, they devote a lot of time to selling the American Gut Project. Which is a good cause, but I would rather they had spent that time teaching me something useful. I resent being duped into watching ads when I've signed up to be educated.The other thing that bothered me was the course required us to divulge a lot of personal information to other students in pointless, time-consuming projects. I didn't learn anything from these projects and found them annoying.",3
93660,"It was a good class to begin with however it would have helped to tailor it more towards newcomers to programming language in general. I also would have like it if Roger would have highlighted or circled, or something to specify where in the slide he was talking about. I felt that at times it was hard to follow where exactly he was talking about and what part of the code/function he was mentioning. Im a visual learner and that would have been greatly beneficial.",3
32154,Though at a high level but I did like the contents and the deliver format which is easy to understand.,3
2535,"I loved this course. The lecture videos taught me a lot and I was happy I got to use whatever I learned in the final project. The only reason why I'm giving three stars was because of the submission process for the final project. It gave me a headache because I didn't really understand how to submit to Tableau public. I tried following the instructions but I couldn't find some things so it confused me a bit. It caused me to submit my assignment late, and it was just not a pleasant process. Maybe upload new instructions with screenshots, or make another lecture video on how to submit.",3
71941,"Good, but I expected more...",3
12052,"It is difficult to complain too much about a free course, but I expected more from a course carrying the name Princeton. The videos were generally well done and interesting, but did contain factual errors almost every week.Unfortunately the instructors were absent from the forums after a couple replies the first week. The homework assignments were disorganized, provided components contained errors, the grading system had problems and the requirements were often unclear. The assignments require Java programming experience (not mentioned in course description). Most importantly, the assignments in no way reflected what was taught in the course videos. They were of course related, but were implementing parts of a bitcoin node, but in a simplified manner. The textbook PDF is good.It would have been nice to have assignments working with real bitcoin (or testnet) transactions, sigs, verification, hashing, etc.Anyhow, I'm enthusiastic about this subject matter, so I'm just happy the course exists, but don't expect a glossy polished course... it's a rough ride.Here is another Bitcoin course that looks good: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/bitcoin-decentralized-technology",3
34621,Well done course. I would have hoped for a little more inspiration and diverse practical ideas. I'd also like the course would more specifically envision a great variety of target audiences.The beginnings are good! Room to spice it up!,3
96199,"Pretty decent breakdown of Bootstrap, but execution can be poor with the assignments. For example, one of the end-chapter assignments is missing complete instructions, and enough digging in the forums refers to, ""a screenshot of the complete instructions"". Rather unacceptable for a peer-reviewed course, okay for a free, self-auditing run.",3
55476,Simple and accessible introduction to Machine Learning for people without strong Maths and IT background. Can become quite slow and boring (almost irritating) if you come from an engineering or technical background (some videos could have been summarised in half of the time).,3
10624,"It was a bit.... general. That could be a bias of mine, as I have done quite a bit of management-type work, so maybe it didn't feel that new or informative.",3
48704,"The content of the course is extremely useful for young emerging scientists like myself; however, the videos were very hard to follow because the team speaks fast and with a very strong French accent. The materials are well-prepared, but my attention kept drifting away from the content due to language impairment. Also, some of the introductory notes were lacking proper grammar and I believe that, in a course with such a theme, this is simply unacceptable. With a bit of work, I think this can be a very useful tool in writing scientific papers!",3
47975,looks good ...lets see how much of help it can be to me Thanks coursera,3
18498,"I learned a lot. Still, I wish the explanation were more geared toward beginners.",3
98174,"Very basic, decent information.",3
87298,Need to add more examples and contents for this class. Homework is so easy,3
79212,Interesting overview on the topic.,3
49972,"The course itself is easy to follow and informative. However, the programming relates primarily to animations so is most appropriate for those interested in design, game design, etc. The course description should better specify this.",3
61472,Good class but very little case studies or real world example.,3
69707,"Well, it is a fairly good introduction to chinese. It's short and easy. However, I expected much more from the course.",3
22728,A very quick overview of finance. Good review of fundamentals but not a lot of depth.,3
68125,"This course introduces the key topics of Machine Learning, but the math behind the algorithms is not explained and the programming exercises are too easy. Unfortunately, it also relies heavily on graphlab instead of using open source software.",3
103937,The format and structure of this class needs some improvement. Having to write some code each weak would be better than answering quizzes and doing the first lines of Swift at the end of the class.,3
27957,Instead of reading blogs and books on graphic design and then following that up with consequent practice I decided to take up this course which would help me do both more efficiently and so far I'm not regretting my decision.,3
27293,Very few topics are covered. Although all the topics that are included are explained very beautifully.,3
18526,"Though it is a nice introduction, I would have expect a more syntax learning lessons.",3
10414,"Good job on the explaining CDN concepts!In the two first modules, the lecturer just read from the slides.",3
103095,Most of the information in the course are available online but still this course will help you align and organize your diet and exercise,3
63354,"Not really a fan of Mick's way of teaching, he seems to have spent most of his time playing with the music or drawing app rather than explaining the features. I also think it would have been helpful to explain more about the purpose of Session.get for retrieving the features and plotting them into data. I think one of the issues with this is there aren't really many active folks on the discussion, so it is difficult to try to find a solution to problems you are having.",3
38317,"Great course but for the amount of content provided and how much was taught this course is certainly overpriced...still a good introductory course, teaching very basic stuff.",3
86499,Somehow this section is bit confusing or rather to say the content is not really enough to work alone. Not even to solve the assignments without example codes.,3
67598,This course rushed through the material at the end.,3
24209,Course is good but mentor grading needs to be a bit sorted as in they required almost 2 additional weeks to grade one assignment in total that is 1 month to grade an assignment so that needs to be taken care of,3
39191,It was good but i felt the last two weeks like stuffing content. I'd have like to dig deeper into mobile development instead of wasting time in appleTV,3
101538,Assignments should be evaluated for all users (unpaid ones as well) like it is done for other Wharton courses.,3
31132,good way to go back to the basics,3
8484,"I believe this course can be performed much faster, beware that it is really an introduction, and IT professionals persons may feel it slow, in addition the presenter speaks English very slowly, good for non English proficient persons, but bad for the others.",3
42415,"Content wise this course is excellent, quant finance enthusiasts would love this course. Truth be told this is an insanely difficult MOOC to pass/complete, not because its hard, lets face it, the contents are very advanced and its assumed that students would have background in advanced finance, but the problem lies in the fact that the professor does not explain the topics well enough. The professor might be excellent in this field but simply can't explain well enough, he is mostly reading his notes/slides with a few drawings. Second problem is the notations used in the course is extremely confusing, it makes maths look scary. This could have been a the best MOOC on Coursera but the professor's explanation is simply not upto the mark.",3
102415,"The beginning is well prepared, interesting and informative, the end is undercooked, subjective and repetitive. Be it 2 separate courses, I would rate them 5 and 2.",3
6228,So easy~But the teacher is well！,3
15641,"The lectures in this class are well done and informative, and they provide a lot of good material. However, the assignment portion needs a lot of work. The instructions weren't clear for anyone taking the class which resulted in incredibly difficult grading. It was hard to even understand the basic ideas of what was required for an assignment.I think the teacher very much needs to go back and change the wording of the assignments, add more information in the instructions, and also post an example to show what is expected since a lot of the assignments are very strange, like a describing a character without mentioning the character in any way.",3
30484,"The course is well structured, but most of the features in the exercises' pages were not working properly. I tried to access them via both my computer (macbook) and mobile phone, but in some cases I could not even complete the exercise or check the answers...",3
96283,"As a beginner, this cours is greate",3
17961,Most stressful but interesting. Not enough material was provided,3
40235,"Good intro - I'm learning a lot. But in the end I feel that this specialization is not focused enough on developing portfolio pieces. One portfolio piece at the end of an 8-month course does not seem adequate to me. So I wish we focused more on developing high fidelity work - in addition to the need-finding, user research, sketches, short weekly assignments. This high fidelity, digital work could even be optional, but I need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should look.Or even being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first 7 sections would be helpful.",3
99677,"This course was very average to me. Compared to the first course in the specialization, Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling, which was absolutely great.What I liked:Good info on the tools in excel that are needed.What I didn't like:Time spent on content that necessarily wasn't regarding models; the critical material was buried in videos and was very brief. More time should have been spent. Additionally the quiz questions were subjective at times based on what was said on video and the formula answers weren't correctly graded in many cases.This course could have been much better, maybe I was just spoiled by the first course.",3
10103,"The professor is well spoken and the class started out very well. But by the final section the hands on example were simply cut-paste with no explanation of what we were doing or how it worked. It's not the fault of the professor but this course and the Big Data specialization attempts to cover too much information. Graph Analytics should be its own 6 course specialization. But really, to understand graph analytics one should be spending a great deal of time with the subject. Perhaps online courses are not the way to understand such a complex subject.",3
104476,not bad but not excellent,3
41534,Did not find it really helpful ...may be the way I expected it was different. Also may be because of my engineering approach towards management. I don't know...But thank you for putting this up and giving me a head start into innovative ideas for starting a new business.,3
67822,That course is quite good to get the fundamental knowledge about power electronics,3
13909,Very basic introductory course. Looking forward to the other modules.,3

61441,I don't like the peer review. I don't find it helpful at all.,3

48714,"It might have been a better option to conduct the class in the instructors' mother tongue with English subtitles, though concepts are well enough communicated. I am a Francophone and I still find it not easy to understand the English (having French translation in my mind.)A good introductory class to have a first glimpse at the general context of academic publishing. Good general overview to rethink the steps of publishing plans for early stage researchers.",3
38966,Very hard and confusing for the beginner,3
27479,Basic content that do not explain how business models are applied in digital world,3
58115,"good , but elementary ( undergrad level)",3
49078,I wasn't able to finish the course,3
80999,"This course has amazing breath. Most other specializations are organized chronologically (i.e. Course 1: Learn Ruby, Course 2: learn about databases with rails, Course 3: Learn about HTML,CSS, JS, etc.) But this introductory course describes everything that goes into making web applications, from front end to back end and compares ruby on rails to the other major frameworks. If you're just trying to get started learning WebApps, as I was, this is very useful.The reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was that there weren't very useful assignments. You learn programming best from doing projects. In this course, there were a few quizes (which aren't as nearly as useful as projects) and the only projects that existed were to simply follow the steps exactly as the professor did in his videos. I think that the makers of the course are 90% of the way to a top course, they just need to add in programming assignments for each week, where you don't just follow the professor. I learned a lot from this course, but without getting the programming projects and exercises needed to reinforce the understanding, it may be hard to retain some of the knowledge.",3
94216,"The videos are really tutorials on R functions for machine learning and data wrangling. A good substitute for ""Machine Learning"" by Andrew Ng in terms of managing data sets and exploratory analysis.",3
101110,good closing course but peer reviewing and no prof is little untraditional.,3
74109,to basic,3
66091,Not that interesting,3
21480,"The course covered the material thoroughly, but the presentation could be improved: 1. the examples, charts and other helpful aside additions could be left on screen during the relevant discussion. I often had to pause and go back to study the material that was only briefly displayed. 2. Using the screen for just a video of the lecturer speaking seems a waste of the many video techniques that could be included, with the lecturer in a small window at the side. 3. Although the lecturers tried not to favor one brand over another, at times it seemed like we were watching an infomercial. Maybe this can't be helped, as all the camera's features, and their accessories, were described in detail. I for one have a camera that I want to learn to use more professionally. Purchase suggestions could be moved to an addendum. In my opinion it should not be in the body of the course material.I am finding a lot of good information in the course, and am continuing with the second section.",3
85598,"Fascinating knowledge delivered by instructors whose first language is definitely not English and who make it difficult to learn by their bad grammar, pronunciation and overall monotonous tone of speaking. However, the knowledge gained in this course is fascinating and I am thankful to the instructors for attempting to instruct more people in regard to this field and the details of it.",3
67051,"I learned quite a lot that I can use for research, personal projects, and general understanding of neural networks, but unfortunately this course is getting quite out of date at this point.

The point was made long before the telling of every plot point in Harry Potter was done. I thought, really, I signed up for four months of this? Then the lectures got better, learning the basis outlines and structures of plot is useful. Simple, but useful.",3

82864,This course fills a gap that is rarely taught by explaining biological origins of musical experiences. The material is very easy to follow. I wish there were more practical exercises or home works to play with the concepts.,3
39384,"I found it was very interesting, for sure, but maybe too focused some times. Also, it seems good for listening to twitter, for example, but not other social medias that could be much more interesting in different situations.",3
14065,"it could have been better if it was more hands-on learning, for instance I don't understand why did we learn CLI till now and how will I link it to my studies",3
68681,"I think that the course is redundant, it is to general, trying to capture to much, and using a commercial program tool that's doing to much behind the scene.The second course in the specialization is really great though and you wont miss anything if you skip ahead",3

7,"I was disappointed because the name is misleading. The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content. It deals with two-speed IT in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey website for example.",3

15285,"From the basic layout of the course you would assume it's for beginners since it covers step-by-step instructions to install software and run command on command line window.But on the other hand, many advanced concepts are slipped in this course without even basic introduction. I remember in one class, ""data dredging"" is discussed for about 2-3 minutes. But the instructor did not give a brief description about what it is, instead it just goes on about when you do not have clear question in your mind, you would run the risk of data dredging.I think the course could be organized in a better way. But I do appreciate the instructors' hard work of putting up such a 10-course specialization.",3
12146,"Given the nature of law courses (a lot of reading), there needs to be a great deal more written information on the lecture slides. Quotes from pieces of legislation, judgements from various courts, quotes from politicians etc. need to be provided on the slides, otherwise students are either left to search through the transcript, which contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, or write what Prof. Gearey is saying which means continuously stopping and starting the lectures to get it all down. IN SHORT: Better lecture slides with more information on.",3
18906,I enjoyed the hands-on aspect of this course. I learned more about using Tableau from it that the prior courses in the specialization. I give this 3 of 5 stars for 3 reasons:1) My classmates and I think that the instructor left one video out the course which is necessary to answer one of the quiz questions.2) The instructions for at least 2 of the peer-graded assignments are incomplete. The grading criteria requires features that aren't mentioned in the instructions. As a result you need to alter and resubmit the assignments in order to meet all the grading criteria.3) The instructor repeats himself in the course videos. He's present a summary of the video while displaying a Tableau screenshot and then repeat the same summary while displaying a Presentation slide. I feel that more time should have been spent reviewing the Tableau features and eliminate the repetition of the material.,3
35400,More timely and relevant text material would have greatly helped in broadening our understanding. Basic and easy for beginners to grasp.,3
5041,"The course has fun illustrations and a high quality of production, but the lessons themselves don't dive very deep. Ideas are introduced but not considered in depth.

78979,"Very mixed feelings about this course.Generally speaking, the course lectures are informative and well organized. Mentors are reallly of great help, they are doing a great job, honestly: they are very active, they give good insights, they know the subject matter.But in the course lectures, there are occasions where concepts are used which were not formally introduced before their actual use.One example: in the lectures on probability, the first ""slide"" in the lecture talks about random processes, outcomes of random process,... On the next slide, the notion of probability of an event is introduced, but the very notion of ""event"" was never introduced. It is introduced in the accompanying book, but if it is the case that the book chapters should be read PRIOR to watching the course videos, that fact should be made clear.Further in the course on probability, some words are used ""interchangeably"" without the context making it clear why they can be used interchangeably. For instance, on some occasions, the concept of independent events is used, but then, later on, the discussion talks of independent processes. Which is which??? Is there a difference? If so, what is it? When do I need to use independent events as opposed to independent processes?The graded assignments are of varying quality. The most disturbing thing about them is that, on some occasions, concepts are used in the quiz questions (either directly in the questions and answer choices, or indirectly in the ""correction"" for the quiz after you have submitted it) that were never touched upon in the course.I have had two occasions of concepts not introduced in the course but used in the graded assignments.The first occurrence of a gap between course content and quiz questions was on a quiz question about inference. I failed the question, and understood why I failed based on the course content litterally minutes after failing the question (and one mentor actually rightly corrected me). But the question ""correction"" (the explanation text you receive after submitting, as justification for what the correct answer is) referred to the concept of ""two-sided hypothesis test"". Where did THAT come from?? I checked and rechecked the course videos, no mention at all of it. I checked the accompanying book, and the first mention of two-sided hypothesis test is way way way further in the book, in a chapter that is entirely focusing on inference.The second occurrence was in week 4. The course lectures cover two distributions: normal and binomial. The recommended reading in the book also focus on these two distributions (the recommended reading actually skips the section on geometric distribution, if I remember well). But in one of the quiz question, there was one of the possible answers referring to the geometric distribution. If it is the case that we are supposed to know and understand about geometric distributions, then the course content should cover the subject. Or at the very least, the course lecture should mention clearly that learners are advised to read about it in the accompanying book.The guidelines for the project assignment (week 5) are not all that clear as to what is expected from the learners. Sure, there are instructions on where to find the info, what structure should be followed,... There is also a very nice ""example"" project (designed by one of the mentors), which provides a lot of useful info (how to filter missing values from variables,...).But there is no real hint as to the depth of analysis we are expected to complete. This is definitely a source of confusion, not only for me, but also for a few other learners, from what I gathered in the discussion forums. The result is that the projects you get to review are of very disparate levels. Some end up in calculating one figure per research question, without any attempt at deriving trends or patterns, others do not include any plots at all,... The thing is that the peer review criteria do not really provide a good basis to ensure that learners did indeed assimilate the course contents. Most of the questions in the peer review assignment have a lot more to do with following a canvas and not so much with the course substance itself.For instance, some of the peer review criteria have to do with the narratives for computed statistics and plots. The criteria are: ""Is each plot/R outout followed by a narrative"", ""Does the narrative correctly interpret the plots, or statistics"", ""Does the narrative address the research question"". But when the research question is a question of the type ""What it the IQR for income per state"", for instance, the narrative can be very short: ""IQR per state shows that the state with higher variability of income is..."". So, the narrative meets the 3 evaluation criteria: there is a narrative, it does address the research question, and it does correctly interpret the statistics. But it is not particularly useful.I do understand that Internet-based peer review is challenging, and that you have to settle for ""neutral"" criteria that are easy to assess by learners. But the peer review grading ""grid"" as it currently stands is not ""that"" helpful in assessing whether the course contents has been assimilated.To conclude, when I took the course, my initial plan was to follow the entire specialization. But after having completed the first course of the specialization, I have radically changed my mind, and will look for alternatives ""elsewhere"" to get the knowledge/skillset that I am after.",3
19211,"It was good, and i learnt a lot, but it vexed me that in the first lesson they stated you didn't need to read music to get on with the course, but everything from then on seemed to require reading music including an very difficult final test reading some complicated Beethoven apparently! I understand why they did it that way, as they are used to reading music, but music can also be described as actual note names and the theory will be learnt nevertheless, without the massive barrier of having to translate it all from musical notation.",3

13817,"The videos are quite interesting, though I think they are overly committed to very specific techniques. I did not, however, find the assignments and peer review system very helpful. People had a tendency, particularly on the first assignment, to read in requirements that were not actually stated or written down and failed people accordingly. There also does not seem to be enough people to review all of the assignments, either--perhaps due to the paywall for assignments. The very nature of the peer review system also guarantees you see a real range on the individual criteria you are evaluated on and the depth of the review. This exacerbates the very harsh ""0 or 1"" point option for all assignments (i.e. either you get a 1 and pass or you get a 0 and fail).Bottom line: I think the course materials are useful and at the very least interesting for developing writers, but I'm not sure it's worth the $79 entry fee to gain access to the peer review, unless you really need or want the course certificate.",3

17332,"This course has appealing assignments and covers interesting topics. The course, however, has two fatal flaws. First, the lectures are a bit disjointed. While there is much to learn in the lectures, the lecturers style is a bit halting and scattered (it would have been much better presented if the lecturer had a script to read off of.) As is, the lectures are mediocre, which is unfortunate since the lecturer is clearly knowledgeable about the topics presented.Second, the assignments suffer from a lack of good error messaging and no support in the forums (aside from what you will find from other students, which can be very helpful at times.) The assignments themselves are a great approach to learning concepts (and you get to work with real data, like the Twitter data), but without good error messaging when you submit a script you pretty much end guessing where you are taking a wrong turn.I had high hopes for this course, but it seems as though it fails on execution.",3

It would have been better to break the philosophy, the ethics, and the science of emotions into separate courses.

I do hope the following series will eventually tackle these issues, and I'll be glad to give the whole series 5 stars.",3
89077,The course content is very superficial. The pass mark is very high for a course I had taken because of a mild interest. You have to get 80% to pass. One unit in particular was very confusing. It took me 7 attempts to pass it as I had no idea what the first question was about and there was no guidance as to what I was doing wrong.,3
83012,"This course was solid overall but not excellent. I learned the basics of different classes of probabilistic models including Bayesian networks and Markov networks and how to represent them. Prof. Koller is knowledgeable and presented the materially logically. With that said, this course could have been a lot better than it was.The honors programming assignments could have been excellent The material was interesting and dovetailed well with the course content. But the assessment process was very frustrating and led to a lot of wasted time debugging that was geared more to quirks of the grader than to course concepts. Both test cases and feedback on failed submissions were woefully inadequate. Some of the quizzes were also frustrating, featuring what I consider to be ""gotcha"" questions geared more to creating a grading curve than to measuring understanding of the material.Advice to course staff: (1) Please provide more test cases on coding assignments (2) Please provide better feedback in submission reports (3) Please monitor the discussion boards more actively for unanswered questions (4) If you want to provide an externally linked executable you intend students to run from Matlab, it's not reasonable to give a 32 bit file in 2017 and send us down a rabbit hole where you suggest we build the executable from source, which in turn requires us to build the boost library from source.",3

64314,"Compared with the regression course, this course was a slight disappointment. 1. there is less material compared to the regression course. Maybe this is because classification concepts are more intuitive. 2. the slides are much less prepared. Some of the sides even re-use earlier lesson slides in the beginning as a ""review"", much like soap operas re-use scenes from earlier episodes as ""memory recall"" to fill air time. 3. the math is more handwavy compared to the regression course. Neither course are supposed to go in depth with proofs, but I felt the regression course was at the right level and this course degraded too far. Do note it's very possible that I'm biased because I have seen more of the material from this course than the regression course.",3
94637,"The course starts with a nice mathematical support. Midway it looses connection with mathematical details in a way that it becomes too vague and does not empower the student to really grasp the concepts.

I toggle from one to another, taking notes from the instructional video when possible. Still, it takes me weeks, not days, to understand what the professor is doing.It is true that there are several online tutorials with regard to using the sketch tools contained within Fusion 360. I have been reviewing the tutorials that I am able to find -- and I have learned quite a bit of ""how-to"" information that this particular module does not provide.Why is it that some of us who are new to the Fusion 360 environment have come to understand that we need to spend hours of our time to ""fill in the blanks"" of week 3?Are we to keep searching other sources so that we can learn what has not been taught in Week 3?

I live in a remote part of Australia where are no universities or public libraries which would have a copy of the book by Calhoun, and even if I had been able to afford the book it would have taken 6 weeks or more to get to me. So I read the alternative readings but it clearly wasn't enough to get the quiz questions right which were obviously extracted directly from content of the Calhoun book. If it isn't possible to make sections of this book available online then you should at least rewrite some of the quiz questions so that they are accessible to students who can't get hold of a copy of the book.",3

2094,The course structure was well formatted. The order of the lessons and content presented made for learning intuitive. The follow along practice queries and end of lesson practice problems were also helpful interactives for the student.However there were mistakes in the answer keys or practice problem prompts that became more frequent in the lessons towards the end of the course. This made it difficult to practice the more complicated material and queries. It was also a big time waster when as a student you were unsure whether you were answering the correct question and if so whether your answer was correct. It would also been helpful to have more open ended practice problems at the end of the course in addition to the set provided.Finally I think this course would be better split into two parts. The first part should be geared towards querying data and focusing more on just pulling data and intermediate queries. The main audience would be analyst/data professionals that have privileges to pull data but not modify data. The second part of the course would be more useful to DBAs or professionals that have database admin privileges to insert/delete/modify data. I would also focus more heavily on database schemas in this second course relative to the first.,3

21727,"To get value from the class, I used other on-line materials to understand the topic. Thus, I spent about 20 hours/week on this class.",3
36628,"Overall this class was a good starting point for basics of finance, but coming from an Ivy League school it could stand a bit more polish and professionalism, especially if Yale University expects people to pay for the class and their accreditation.The instructor has an odd speech manner which takes a little bit of time to get used to, but doesn't detract from the material.The tests are not difficult but the questions are often poorly phrased, such as questions that ask you what a certain term of art is while none of the answer choices are descriptions of the term of art and the correct answer is an application of the term that does not actually answer the call to question.Most of the videos are cobbled together excerpts from lectures the professor previously gave. As such they cut out randomly, have issues with the sound volume, and often discuss material that was cut out prior to the section or should come later, but never does. Not the biggest problem once you get used to it, because the course is an overview, but it's still kind of annoying and not very professional compared to other courses available.The instructor is clearly very pro-capitalism, which is a mixed bag. On one hand he's very knowledgable and communicates a lot of really good information. On the other hand he's also very clearly biased bordering on utopic about the benefits of capitalism and glossing over a lot of the down side risks that are inherent in finance. To be clear this criticism is not of the Professor, or to say that down side risk and risk management are not sufficiently discussed, but merely that IMHO the course could benefit from more discussion and material on the negative aspects/ramifications of unfettered capitalism, especially given the large amount of time spent discussing the 2008 recession.All that being said, I learned a lot from this course and found it very interesting and informative. While I have a prior basis in the material that helped, I learned a lot of new things and still came away with a better understanding of finance and the international financial system. I would recommend anyone who wants to expand or create a knowledge basis in finance and financial institutions take this course.",3

52389,"Much better than the first course on the specialization. More structured, easier to follow. The final assignment was challenging but not out of reach.",3
16849,"On the positive side I emphasise the importance of bringing this topic to a Coursera course. Also the readings were important and added value to the learning experience.On the other hand there are - in my opinion some aspects that made this course a not so rich experience. First, there are some audio issues in the videos. Second, the quizzes are excessively easy and the in video quizzes should not appear in the weekly assignments. If there are required readings, some of the quiz questions should relate to those readings. This way students had an incentive to go over those readings. But the most salient thing that made my experience very limited was the fact that one of the instructors - the one that presented most of the videos, was excessively nervous and all that he did was read the slides, in most cases not doing so naturally and committing errors, rephrasing, stopping, changing speed. I found it very, very difficult to follow along what he was saying. I had to focus only on the slides, otherwise I would get distracted. I think it is ok to be nervous or at ease, but the team should alerted him to this, and shoot the videos again and again until they had acceptable and balanced quality.A minor thing, I would like to had available the weekly slides to further reflection. I think the video issues that I've mentioned should been carefully planned before this course made it mainstream.This is my opinion. Hope it will help you for future improvements of the course and/or other offerings.Ricardo Oliveira",3

17938,"As a capstone to a series of courses that covered data science and R, I found this one to be a bit lacking. There was no involvement from the professors at JHU or the folks at SwiftKey. As was mentioned in another review, the course feels abandoned. All you get a few short (two minutes or so) videos that give you little in the way of instruction or direction. Basically, they just say, ""Go do this. Good luck!""There were also no Mentors or TAs to guide students or answer questions. It was the students helping each other through the forums. Sometimes it was helpful and everyone involved learned something. Other times, it was the blind trying to lead the visually-impaired.On a positive note, you will use all of the skills from the previous courses: writing R functions, performing exploratory analysis and publishing it via RPubs. Your final product will be displayed for everyone via ShinyApps and a presentation using R Presentation (also published via RPubs).On a(nother) negative note, the topic of Natural Language Processing is not an easy one to just walk into and feel confident in providing a working next-word prediction algorithm in about eight (8) weeks. You're reading academic journal articles, watching multiple videos from another Coursera course (which actually focuses on the topic of NLP, and takes place over several courses and several months!).Supposedly, there is work going on to update the course, so hopefully future students will get a better experience. I did take a bit away from this course, especially since I made more than one attempt to complete it. However, it was definitely a shock to find myself missing those things that one typically finds in a learning environment -- descriptive background, assistance to problems, etc. -- and seeing that I was for all intents and purposes on my own. Even in the professional world of data analysis, I have never experienced the lack of support that I found in this course.With that, I am giving it three (3) stars. As I said, I did learn a bit, but it was a bit of a struggle that required multiple attempts to complete. This would have been better off as a stand alone topic (which it already is by another Coursera affiliated school), or having a capstone course that builds on a topic more in the wheelhouse of the JHU professors: a capstone project focusing on bioinformatics or biostatistics would have been amazing in comparison to this.",3
71490,"This is a reasonably thorough introduction to the principals of functional programming in scala, but to fully grasp the material presented I found it necessary to include supplemental material such as the functional programming in scala book by Paul Chiusano (forward by the course instructor funnily enough). One point of frustration however was the near total unavailability of the course TA's or instructor. Also because the only forum for interacting with them is entirely public it's impossible to receive any formal code review apart from the automated tests they run when you submit. There were multiple occasions where I wanted feedback on not just the technical correctness of my solution but also to know if there might have been a more idiomatic or generally efficient (read: tail-recursive) way to express some peculiar bit of logic.",3

I particularly appreciated the advice on how to improvise through out the course. I was less keen on the parts on modes and pentatonics but on the other hand for someone further along in their musical journey it may be just the thing. Although the course is ostensibly on the blues it also covers a lot of material relevant to Jazz.Pedagogically there were some problems.I think the course has way too much material and could be split into 2 parts each part maybe a bit slower.The presenter need to sharpen up his game a little as regards presentation skills, reading material of an IPad is not very inspiring. His English is not very idiomatic but that's not really a big problem. Written sheets with the changes and summarizing the lectures would have made the course better. Finally there are no peer reviews and all quizzes are theoretical - rather disappointing. I prefer a hands on approach with peer based reviews as in Gary Burton's course also on Coursera.",3

I had to use other sources to help such as Codeacademy and Udemy just to keep up. The do not go over loops, conditionals or basic C foundation that would help. The leap from HTML, CSS to JavaScript is massive. They need to relook some of the topics and either more videos or add in some easier teaching methods. I took a similar one on Udemy (that was free) just after I completed this one and it was 10x easier to understand and closed so many loops I had when learning JavaScript.",3

77280,"All of the review I've read were that the course was great, so maybe it is me that was the problem. However, as I would go through the written material, I would try to work the problems given as examples, and when they did not work, I was confused and wondered why the example given to teach us would not work. I asked for help a number of times, providing screen shots of the results I got trying to duplicate what the example was supposed to show, and page numbers of where the example was presented in the course materials. One former student basically said that I should not be trying to duplicate the examples, but just accept the concept they were trying to show. Another did a good job of explaining one of my questions, but then all replies to my question ceased. I decide to drop out of the class and try teaching myself, as I have done on everything I have learned about computers since my 1st computer in 1983. I have been very impressed with other courses given by Coursera members, but this one was not one of them.

If an auto-grader or a way to ensure that everybody who turns in assignments will get those assignments graded back quickly could be implemented this would be a stellar class.

Hopefully MOOCs start having challenging assignments too.The instructor explained really well too!I didn't really end up visiting the Discussion Forums for this course at all. So can't comment on the participation from other students or TAs.Future Advice -Considering how other courses offer about 1-2 hours of course videos, I think this course could offer a lot more.

72576,"This course offers great background instruction on Machine Learning and I would give it 5 stars except for the following:First, there doesn't seem to be any moderation of the session discussions except for help from other students. This was worth a -2 star penalty. This and the lack of any review of linear algebra and vectorized solutions, I think, is giving some students the impression that they should be coding loops in their functions to build and solve ML models.Next, I am auditing the course, and this is the first course where I was not able to submit quizzes. Therefore, I can only guess at my solutions. This was worth a -1 star penalty.UPDATE: not being able to submit quizzes is a ""feature"" of the new Coursera platform. I never did get an answer from the discussion forums, but I see the same problem in other Coursera courses I am taking.However, I still think the course is worth taking, so I added back a star. This is the second ML course I have taken. The first was from Stanford ML course which was very specific to implementation in the Octave language.

82681,I was expecting this course to be more challenging than Functional Programming Principles in Scala but found this one easier in the end. The assignments were ok but I felt like they could have been more challenging and also that they should have tested my understanding of the course contents more thoroughly.,3
3790,"Very basic overview of the Arduino system. Was expecting to be a bit more comprehensive. However, the final module is worthwhile, even if you know a little arduino programming.This course is baby steps to Arduino programming.",3
103582,"This course is a useful if superficial introduction. The concepts presented are pretty basic, but foundational. The quizzes are very easy.The instructor covers the topic in a pleasant and clear way. I would, however, have liked examples of a more visual nature (show don't tell).Ironically, the course materials show disappointingly little concern for user experience or design. The slides look like they were thrown together in a rush and without much care for design or even spell-checking. The quiz multiple choice answers are laid out in an awful, confusing, anti-UX way. Someone should spend a few minutes fixing all of this.",3
68384,"Nice overview of the specialization. Since it aims at showing the advanced and interesting things you will learn during the specialization, some of the practical sessions are way too advanced. Thus, for me felt more like a mechanical copying of what the instructors did rather than an actual assessment of what I understood. Also, since some of the applications are actually repeated at the beginning of the main courses, it feels like a repetition somehow when then you move to the specialized courses.",3
52361,"Relevant and well organized material when looking at it, but in total it is way too thin. More tips and tricks about Xcode as a tool would have been nice. Some of the videos are pretty unrehearsed. One of the lecturers hesitates and stutters a lot.As for the final assignment. Being reviewed by only three persons is too few. One of my reviewers had problems with his Xcode environment and couldn't run my submission. Guess how he graded me. The other reviewers had no problems, luckily.There is almost no help to be found in the discussion forums, which seems pretty buggy. There are no TAs and the staff doesn't seem to be very active either.I'm sure the course will improve in the future. It's at the time of writing the only Swift/Xcode/iOS MOOC on Coursera.",3
76529,Too easy.,3
23840,more scientific evidence would have been useful,3
11211,"The course is all comprehensive about models and concepts of communication science, however the break-down into small lectures turn out to be too brief in my opinion to develop rich understanding of the subject. It would be more conducive that lecturer expands more on the cutting edge study and research, to give people a sense of the finding of the field and its benefits.",3
14519,"Well presented, but this course should be optional in in the specialization. There isn't really enough material to justify it, but it does cover the basics for someone with little to no development experience.",3
4366,"It was hard to follow along with the lessons, because it was mainly present in formulas. More examples might help students relate the information better.",3
94539,"This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization. I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available. Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums. I have seen most of the questions just being discussed among the students. A little disappointed. Will probably have to watch all the material again to have confidence with it.",3
1789,"A lot of time devoted to the job stuff may not be super relevant for most students, and was certainly not super relvant too.",3
91012,Not such a great course. Lectures don't cover what is needed in some assignments. Week 3 assignment was the hardest I ever took. Just plenty of work to be done and small amount of that work is going to stay with you. There is a lot of space to improve this course.,3
29185,"The course was good, but I think that only it's really enjoyable if you have a dog. As the professor says, both the book and the online resource Dognition isn't needed for the completion of this course. The book was really good, but I think that Dognition was too expensive, especially if you haven't a dog (not useful).",3
82642,"This course was significantly less instructive than the first. Assignments did not lead me as constructively through the material. Also the few videos with the other lecturer in week 4 are very confusing, hard to understand, or even appreciate in light of all the other material. I do not think that I have understood futures and am glad it was not required for the last assignment as the answers aren't present in the material.",3
33327,"While the textbook used in this course provide a lot of useful background to the Internet, it's history and trends...etc All good knowledge. I am not sure it's the best teaching tool for this course. It lacks the structure to build up a solid foundation of HTML. If the course stops here, the text may be a good reference for students to explore on their own. With CSS and javascript later in the series, I felt a stronger (both in depth and coverage) HTML proficiency is needed.",3
9790,"The lecture was very abstract and difficult. I could pass the course somehow by writing the code presented in the lecture, but I must say I understand less than the half of the course contents.###Responding to question from the instructor, I clarify the comments above.I found the whole lecture difficult. This may be because the subject is not something I have even thought about. It was difficult to understand the difference and importance of key concepts such as trie, suffix, class, etc. Overall, I learned that the tricks somehow work, but my comprehension was not as deep as I can think about the extension or applications. I guess more examples or providing intuition would help me to digest the material.",3
19866,"The scoring of the Peer Review, was not really measurable of your effort.",3
87759,"Course had pretty good basic information for people not familiar with programming. I would like to have seen more in-depth tasks or project(s) that would require deeper exercise of the topics covered in class. Each assignment boiled down to parsing a file using specific method (reg ex, Beautiful Soup, XML, or json libraries) to do the same task. Requiring people for instance to build additional data types already taught (lists, dictionaries) would have been at least little more challenging.Overall it is a good basic intro class.",3
29100,"THIS COURSE IS INTERESTING,INFORMATIVE AND USEFFUL. RIGHT NOW I AM HEADING TOWARDS END OF THE COURSE. IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS COURSE FOR EVERYBODY.",3
64470,average course not too good not too bad,3
71163,"The assignments took me so long. It was supposed to be 3 hours but, got obsessed to have them ended ok, but in 15 hours nearly. I would recommend to build up from very basic stuff, and as the learning advances, going into more difficulty.The hints for the assignments were valid in the the last lesson, but for another lesson, I think lesson 4, there was no hint.Thanks",3
6544,Learned a lot and already integrated daily meditation into my life.,3
92880,The instructor gave us homework on materials that were not taught in the lectures. This was a little unfair. It may be the way to teach for in-person learning but it is frustrating for an online course. Others have commented on the rapid pace. I would not mind the rapid pace if the materials presented were also the ones tested.,3
106295,The coding assignment instructions are near impossible to follow. The lecture is monotonous in the later weeks.,3
12981,"The course isn't bad, but the videos explanations are all way to general, they should be more detailed.",3
93637,I think the jump in difficulty from week 1 to week 2 is discouraging to many students with little to no R experience.,3
102329,I am disappointed by not being able to do the assignments unless I pay for the course.,3
83445,Needs to cover a bit more,3
4371,"This quickly became a statistics course, which although important was really difficult for me as I went in not expecting it.However, Dr. Egger is incredible! I think he's a fantastic and well-versed instructor in the Data & Analytics realm and am eager to find ways I can use what I've learned into practice at work.",3
18440,Cannot participate in graded work unless purchased.,3
26218,"The final lab had an error that took a long time to find a solution for, which was disappointing. For a paid course, you would expect the labs to be better quality tested.",3
32530,I think that the above course was a little bored. I would like something with more practice and less theory.,3
49673,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good course, the teacher obviously knows his stuff and delivers the information in a good way. It gives you what you need to know. But I expected more. A wider grasp on things, additional readings, quiz’s, related articles, links and so on. Maybe not mandatory but in addition to what already is there.",3
11081,The course content is interesting and well laid out. The lack of contact details for course queries is concerning as is purely being assessed by peers who may not follow the grading guidelines very well (providing no feedback etc),3
82306,"Videos are easy to understand and follow, but there's sometimes to little background knowledge about writing good apps, security and good practices. The communication with the server and what would look like the final working product is not explained at all.",3
15311,"A decent start for anyone interested in learning the basics. However, please make sure you add extra efforts from your end in understanding stats concepts if you are totally new to the subject as well as browsing things related to usage of SAS or python. The course touches only the basics so it is up the learner to explore and learn more about interested statistical tool.",3
60556,"long lectures, hard to understand material. Filmed in interesting locations relating to subjects. Not easy but worth the effort",3
21404,"Good course, teaches how are actually big dairy enterprises, in a country with unlimited resources, it`s not usefull in develeping countries, and doesn`t teach how to understand the way to start a business and the differences in small, medium, big and gigantic business in diary production. Aren`t there any small diary farm en USA ? It`s not feaseble to start a small diary business in USA? How different in costs and profit are diary in different countries?, How USA government helps diary business in USA? Thanks for your teaching and Sharing your experiences.",3
85733,Informative. Good introduction to basics in Project Management. Might have been helpful to have more case studies.,3
12244,"I think that , this course need to add more keys critical important point in each lesson by keywords on Videos. And examples how to use these skill on nature life",3
86687,"Nice course, with very introductory information.",3
91349,"This course has a great potential, but the subject of each week was very superficial. The speaker is very good, your english is clear and easy to understand. The subject covered is interesting, but could be more deeper.",3
51098,"Overall this course has covered a lot of good and interesting information! I found the presentation to be lacking somewhat as the course-leaders were reading off the info in front of the camera, which gave the lectures an artificial sort of feel. I did enjoy the different interviews along the way, which spiced things up a bit. The grading of this course needs to be revised, in my view, as some things will go amiss when students grade each other. All in all it's clear that a lot of work has gone into this course, and that is definitely to be commended by all involved.",3
39802,It was more historical than I expected. Gave me some new and interesting knowledge especially in security topic.,3
90933,"I truly love the course program and what it covers. And aiding student who can't afford the price by grants is relly nice. Then were students alloweed to download MATLAB freely! But teachers should be clear from the begining, what topics one must grasp before getting one's head into it. I don't think calculus and Linear algebra is enough, given some topics that are spoken about in the course. The teacher can explain mean things and in a second, speaks about totally incomprehensibe subject. Last but not least, I personally think the course lacks on additional materials. It would be really nice if there was something like handouts, pdf readings for deeper understanding of the concepts on offline times.",3
79241,"Concise but too concise I feel. Maybe it's meant for more foundation/beginner level ? Else, need more details. Not just overview.And, need more involvement/engagement from students, need multiple (randomized per attempt) questions in quizzes, need participation from course producers/TAs for questions and clarifications needed by students (in discussion forums).",3
11429,This course mainly focus on statistics and statistical parameters and almost nothing about about Understanding Clinical Research - as title anotate,3
88581,Concise. Would give it 5 starts if there were more simulations.,4
79886,Excellent! Clear and concise,4
62912,"A good oportunity to learn business English, communication and much more.",4
71177,Good Course! Helps to get the basic concept of Functional Programming.,4
12373,Good course content with great examples,4
6207,I think it is a good class overall but the pace is fast and the resources that can help you is lacking. This will be good for someone who already kind of understands bioconductor.,4
74962,Some of the lectures could be a little more direct. Some of the examples/ exercises could could be more concise. Thanks!,4
24235,I think it is a good courseany one can get benefits,4
2100,"Very useful and well-designed course. Jana is an effective instructor with a great sense of humor. Her course material is easy at first and gradually gets harder, which is suited for students with no SQL background but eager to learn. But this course does require a lot of your time and dedication ---- Plan 5 hours every week and sometimes even more (week 4 and 5). It took me 2 rounds of enrollment to earn the certificate. All in all, I would recommend this course to people interested in data analytics, who want to update their knowledge beyond excel and have the time and the drive.",4
47979,Several good and useful study methods and techniques were discussed. At times I felt that unrelated and digressing topics were covered,4
329,"A little tough sometimes, but very instructive",4
14172,Very good in setting up for the next courses. I would like to see more on Git though because I could have definitely understood it a bit better,4
733,Interesting course. Valuable insights into network effects.,4
11045,Very informative course. I like the ocntent of it and how it progresses through it. However I think it can improve in termms of practical examples on the differences when changing values of parameters.,4
39131,"this course is awesome , i'm going to learn JS Fundamental programming",4
65773,Great course to built basic skills.,4
1999,"Very interesting introduction to the business intelligence, totally recommended.",4
78142,"A bit of a slow start, but that's probably necessary for a programming course. Good way to get started. Definitely need to take the follow-up courses.",4
77216,I felt unprepared for Exercise 5.2. Otherwise good.,4
68864,Really great one!!,4
77835,Good course.,4
68640,"The course is great, you do learn a lot of the general concepts. I wish they would use general python packages instead of graphlab, but this is not a deal breaker.",4
19710,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was very informative. I would like to see more up-to-date data incorporated (I did this course in 2017 and the data used was current to 2013). The videos were clear and easy to follow and understand and the recommended reading materials were appropriate to the subject areas.,4
91171,Great course. Very interactive and content well explained!,4
37657,Teacher was very good.,4
19743,it is an excellent course for beginners.,4
92991,The videos were informative but i didn't feel like we used the concepts from the videos very frequently.,4
60549,I do not intend to write the final essay. I took the course for personal interest and accomplsihed my goals.,4
2190,"Very good, detailed course, I can recommend! Before that I knew nothing about SQL, now I have moved to higher level of analyst. Sometimes the instructions are not 100% clear, but it is minor problem.",4
55285,These lectures help me learn the basic knowledge about machine learning!,4
85662,Some creative stereo FX will be better for the course,4
47050,One more teacher better,4
101487,"Could use a lot more practices & examples. Overall, it's great!",4
78887,"The stats info and exercises were helpful for learning stats/probability. The labs were somewhat helpful, but did NOT prepare you for the project at the end of the course. Prerequisites say not necessary to know R coding, but I REALLY struggled getting through the assignment in a timely manner and eventually wasn't happy with what I had to submit to make the deadline. I highly recommend taking a few courses in R in DataCamp or watching videos about R Studio (dplyr and tidyr) before attempting the labs and project.",4
94157,"This course is an excellent survey of introductory sales techniques and thinking. In addition, it allows you to access Craig Wortmann's ""Sales Toolkit"", which I think is highly valuable and able to be carried over into other personal/professional situations. However, the rigor of feedback from classmates was sometimes lacking, and the problem sets/videos took hardly any time. More time could be spent on them, but without more intense feedback from seasoned sales professionals, it might not be worth the investment. Overall, I am satisfied with having paid for this course in order to get that feedback and the certificate.",4
69481,"Really good, bite-sized information to get started on Mandarin",4
91240,This course is very useful for someone if have pronunciation problems. It's more about fluency and your pronunciation.Hope you all get the those skills.,4
8208,"I really liked the course and how it is designed, I think it is very useful to get familiar with aspects related to pronunciation , intonation and rythmn. Most courses only provide useful expressions and specific vocabulary but this course offers the possibility of sounding natural and fluent in business environments.",4
102308,"Good, thorough and informative description of SEO",4
27933,"A decent course, but flawed by student reviewers with subjective opinions.",4
36703,Great course a bit tricky but understandable.,4
34476,"This is a pretty good intro to Excel course. It gets a little patchy in Weeks 3 and 4 (it seems like some of the worksheets weren't checked for errors), but it never wastes your time. It's a great way to get an initial feel for how to do commonly-used professional functions in Excel. I'm glad I took it, though I do wish there had been more of a progression. For example, it would have been nice if there was a final, project due at the end that put together a lot more of what was covered rather than just reviewing the few functions learned in Week 4.",4
25031,"One of my favorite ones up to now, long and interesting classes with amazing artists.",4
27625,the course is great. also I would like to thank coursera for the fee-waiver opportunities without which people like me could never afford to take such high quality and up to date trainings!,4
11831,It is a nice introductory course on Baysian s,4
43506,5 stars if the audio from the videos would remain at a consistent level and also would be amplified a bit more as i often have it maxed out and still have trouble hearing much of the vid content. The content itself is priceless imo. Really excellent tools that you'll use the rest of your life.,4
27565,simply interesting,4
29688,"it is very helpful, and if could have more details about sample essays, would be better.",4
3593,I give really high marks for this course as the graphs are presented in a proper and practical manner. I have a suggestion to present the High Level of Graphs more in the area of Information theory. Otherwise it is nice approach and very good implementation of the material and exams.,4
3227,clear and the examples are very useful!,4
74163,"Very Nice interface, Mobile friendly, Just for writing coding assignments I had to use laptop. If App supported the same, It would have been more convenient. While course syllabus is direct and gives one idea of applying teaching for practical purpose, which is good right. And Faculty is nice, explains the concept in easy way.",4
90901,Great assignments to solidify an excellent curriculum.,4
23059,Its a very good course to cover basics on eating habits,4
692,"Not the best, but if you are a newbie in management field you can find valuable information inside.",4
100508,Great set up with attainable and realistic assignments that are relevant and thought provo for a new researcher.,4
22414,"Great course, especially useful to learn the specific vocabulary and get insights into Financial Analysis. I found some topics could have been explained more thoroughly, for example regarding the evaluation of discount rates or number of time period (we have the criteria, but no example of a method). Previous accounting knowledge is a requirement in my view.",4
3891,"I felt like the C Programming parts were a bit too fast, specially the enviroment setup. But I loved this course! Congratulations and thank you!",4
7029,simple and don't need much background knowledge,4
48743,4P theories is applied in cross country cross industry analysis. I think it is very innovative and easy to apply. Wish you could enjoy the course!,4
36753,Received theoretical as well as practical knowledge from the course,4
88892,Very informative and engaging. Covers a wide range of material without feeling cumbersome.,4
104085,A very hands on approach to systems thinking that introduces you to modeling software for real life use.,4

49578,Very good introduction.,4
36777,"This cours it's very interesting, it gives you a lot of very good tips for improve your skills communications, some videos are not excellent in terms of edition but i recommend this course for those who are open to learn about writing effective emails and those who want to learn more business terms.",4

105363,Some problems with tasks.,4
96464,I love the course and thanks Coursera to give me the chance to attend the course for free.,4
12856,great course,4
97388,"The material is very, very good!I am not very confortable with the professor as a lecturer, though. He is very distractig. At the end I opted for just reading the transcripts instead of watching the videos.It is slightly annoying that the References are not properly quoted sometimes.",4
16316,A great insight on the classical sociologists,4
87801,It would be much better if the difficulty of programming homework is harder.,4
28806,"So far, so good! Just about to start week 2 of this course and it has been good so far.",4
20873,Gave a good overview of the financial markets. I had enrolled thinking it would be on the Indian financial markets. Would be great if there was a similar course based on Indian markets.,4
13993,It would be better if we can attempt the assignments even if we are not enrolled to the course. It would really help us to evaluate ourselves about the extent to which we have understood the concepts.,4
28898,This course was fun and it re-opened my eyes and mind to how happy life can be if we remove/ take control of our own mental obstacles.I would recommend to anyone who's cup isn't full.,4
18760,Good course. I feel like Week 4 could have been explained slightly better but otherwise I really enjoyed it.,4
61849,Nice material and instructor. Thanks a lot!,4

49471,A good introductory course !!! Should be followed up with lots of readings ...,4
60886,"Very interesting course, Thanks I learned so much !",4
78750,"The course was overall simple and easy to learn the basics of python. Even you don't have any background experience in programming, you can learn A-Z with this course.",4
70758,Was great I enjoyed the whole project working with processing applets,4
97971,"Interesting course that clearly describes design thinking. Some of the lectures are really excellent, although some did not meet my expectations. My only other problem was that at times I felt more like I was watching an advert for the course creator's book rather than learning about Design Thinking.",4
25327,"A very basic course, and oriented more towards economics and predicting behaviors. The course sure is nice, but not what I had expected. Wanted something more on the logic side. The one by Stanford looks better-suited.",4
97741,The final project gives a deeper insight and understanding of how to apply the strategist's toolkits in creating valuable competitive position for an organization. Great Professors,4
13550,The optional videos are not allotted enough time. Those concepts are difficult to grasp.,4
10577,This course is quite best for a student want to learn basics properly.👏👏🌟,4
64128,"The course is very interesting and has a lot of content, but it could be more structured.",4
16111,"PDF slides would have been appreciated. The course is good, contents are good.",4
24436,"have not finished it yet , but a very good course so far, a lot theory mixed with exercises.",4
63824,"The course was very intersting and the Colleen was Really Wonderful.The one think that let me down is that i felt there wasn't enough material. The main ideas went again and again.Beside, I think that it was good combination between technical practice and therotical priniciples.",4
94772,"Fascinating historical, sociological, cultural, and literary journey through the Holocaust and the years preceding and following.",4
100453,I like the first E-tivity where we were asked to do the reading and listen to the video then come up with our own research question. I wished the rest of the course had continued along the same line where we can create a possible framework of what our research would have looked like by utilizing the ideas developed during the videos and readings.,4

103565,Gives different perspective on the Cyber Security field.,4
15042,"Easy to follow. Might be too easy for some people with experience in data analysis. However, the instructors also talk about some frameworks and insights from their experience which could be helpful for even those who have experience.",4
90604,"Everything is good,but the assignments are a little hard,haha",4
84505,Grate course... Thanks!,4
2161,"It's pretty good for entry-level SQL learners. However, to further improve, much time is required. Also, exercises provided are sometimes really weird.",4
75386,Nice course. I got basic information from this course.,4
47983,A practical and useful course for any body at any stage in life,4
94199,"Good course on the whole, learned a lot and enjoyed it, but it would need to be updated and corrected (certain bits of code don't work as they did when the course was produced, which can be pretty confusing). Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course : the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed, and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful. Anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity, keep it up ! Cheers",4
61885,"Here you will learn the basic skills for writing and judging proofs.At core, the taught material consists of the content of Keith Devlin's book 'Introduction to Mathematical Thinking', which is available for low fee. But at this course are come lots of students together and they can help each other at struggling through the plenty exercises which accompany the lectures. And there is also some help from several mentors.In the last week you have to write your own proofs at ten problem sets and peer reviewing them for lots of other students.negatives: Because the instructor suggested group building over the net, It happened at my course that the course participants was split to plenty small groups. And although it's a pretty good Idea that the Instructor presents the learning stuff at the videos by writing it on a small sheet with a pen, his handwriting is sometimes so terrible that it's hardly to read.",4
43785,"It was a very helpful course, thank you Coursera Team for this cheerful journey.",4
30646,"This was a very well done course with many different ways to practice the skills being taught. There are a few bugs in the assignment section, particularly in week 4, that impacted students' ability to review one anothers' work.",4
71805,"As such the course content was very good and useful for developing the concepts. I would advise the content design team to expand the teaching examples to areas outside of the US as well, as the business conditions in other regions might be different.",4
30903,It is a very complete overview. It is very helpful for reviewing English grammar and punctuation. The additional resources are also very good.,4
78371,Very Good Beginner Course for Python. Pretty short in material length but if you are looking to start programming I would strongly recommend it. Very good examples and quizes at the end of each section make sure you know your stuff.,4

3234,"Examples are clear, very good introductory course. Can using w3schoool as reference",4

16367,This was good module. It covers the basics of inferential statistical techniques along with its application using SAS/Python. I would definitely recommend to take up if you are a beginner.,4
79835,Great and informative!,4
16418,Great intro to a complex topic.It could be improved by having the programming assignments be:+ Mandatory+ More related to actual cryptographic algorithms/libraries (only some are),4
59648,"I would give 4.5 stars but not full marks because I don't believe there is sufficient support for novice programmers. More worked examples earlier on with MatLab would have been invaluable and the first week could have an easy programming project to establish the basics via practical experience rather than lecture.However, I found the material to be otherwise fascinating and inspiring in the potential power of Machine Learning to apply mathematical principles to ameliorate the human condition. This has confirmed the path I have chosen. Thank you.",4
8552,Good intro,4
80865,The course content was good.,4
81764,It's an incredible course with detail explanations and interactive quizzes.,4
17086,"Very interesting course with clean slides and good understanding of the key concepts. A bit more ""practice"" would have been better, but I still highly recommend this course for a basic knowledge in digital marketing.",4
56677,You will learn the ML's principles.,4
20322,"Great course! Would have given it 5 stars , but this first course by itself is not much. I'm definitely going to check out the other courses in the specialization, as I'm pretty confident that as a whole it will be more complete.",4
69625,"Very nice course... but very, very basic.",4
30067,"I am glad to have learn and understood better what was covered in this class. I think there would have been opportunity to explore grammar even more, deeper.",4
14875,The first week's quiz is really difficult and I had to go through the lecture material several times. Because of the great number of very short lectures it is difficult to find an asnwer to sought question.,4
47197,Many learning techniques was exposed in this course and they help me alot on my learning adventures.,4
13464,"Although all coursera courses are same, the peer assessment is very useful for this course. It's very helpful to see products made by other people.",4
96999,very useful,4
12114,The course is very helful in understanding the various concept of scheduling. The course material gives to the poibt views and examples to understand tbe concept and very nicely delivered.,4
3747,very nice tutorial on Arduino programming for beginners like me.,4
57422,Very good introduction and exercise in the fundamentals of modern machine learning.Would be better if an optional reading list of key articles/books in the field were provided.,4
11063,"Very interesting and motivating course, thanks a lot for it.Only one star less because all the videos i've seen shows lots of computers in closed areas, lacks connection to another ""real world"": nature, plants, animals, rocks, sports ... and everything that can be learned at school. I love blended learning, and i would like to have more examples ""outdoor"" to be totally convinced and inspired...",4
90607,it was a good course,4
19867,"Great lectures from Larry bourgerie! I really enjoyed the course, though had some difficult time with the peer graded assignment.",4
30003,the lecturer's voice is too low,4
81914,"I really liked the course as a review of basics. However, the final assignment seemed a bit of a stretch from the course material.",4
46419,Very simple and to the point-- I found the info on procrastination most helpful. Wish there had been more of the neuroscience information that was briefly provided in the male professor's lectures.,4
39339,A really interesting and useful course!,4
96170,good instructions,4
79087,The material is good and the professor is clear and knowledgable. Hopefully there would be more reference documents recommended.,4
96052,This is an inroductory cousre tou,4
20831,"I really enjoyed this course, and as an Australian it is so exciting it comes form a domestic university. Thank you",4
100448,Should be a mandatory class before you have to do a research project.,4
95143,"I found that the videos weren't entirely helpful when tackling the assignments. I had to outsource most, if not all, of my inquiries to external sources (read: stack overflow). Even simple things such as advanced indexing, such as multi-indexing, was unclear. I understand that not everything can be covered, but I feel that basic things should be. Other than that, I enjoyed using the Jupyter notebook, and thought this was integrated very nicely into the coursework.",4
15876,"This is a fun and engaging class. I was challenged by the assignments on so many levels while taking this class. They have encouraged me to try new things even if it seems ridiculous to others. I especially liked the feedback, the constructive critiques all helped me through this course.",4
57377,"well explained, detailed",4
57549,"A great, succinct course is for begin learner.",4
79852,"Nice basic course of project management, with basic to medium level information. Good introduction to the subject if you follow the whole specialization.",4
48778,"Is a nice course to learn about the different styles of leadership, how to work better in teams and which are the best outcomes of a negotiation.",4
50057,Great course. I learnt the importance and use of a good docstring! Some of the quizzes are a bit heavy going.,4
94354,A good course where you can learn how ML algorithms work practically.,4
95477,"Great! Even for someone with some python / pandas experience, it was a nice refresher / found new tips / tricks. I actually enjoyed the fact that the assignments didn't hold your hand and forced students to solve problems with the forum and other resources. Look forward to the rest of the courses in this specialisation!Two aspects you could improve is teaching is (1) Multiindex and (2) Regex. It seemed like you purposely avoided discussing these. These should be a mandatory subjects to learn.",4
17749,Good short introduction to the field who someone with minimal understanding of data science.,4
101832,"Very in-depth and in-deep into Digital Marketing. Great Lecturer, Great Job",4
53285,"A pretty cool intro to machine learning, though I'd loved to have more mathematics, I'm sure that it's made this way to match most peoples' needs, Prof. Andrew is a great lecturer",4
61018,I personally think online courses are difficult since there is self-discipline involved but I like how organized the course is!,4
68026,"Good introduction to machine learning concepts and I'm looking forward to a deeper dive in later courses. Would have preferred the course use industry standard, open source tools, but GraphLabs/SFrames didn't cause an issue for me at all.",4
41973,The course was beneficial to me and I learned a lot of new things. I took one star because of the assessment of students who are too poorly evaluated.,4
82915,"Very interesting courses, with a good theory basis in portfolio manangement",4
14234,One of the best course to get into the field of Data Science.,4
87970,"Course is well organized, speaker is knowledgable and really enthusiastic.",4
27145,i like the course,4
40323,"I wish we could still get a course certificate, even if you haven't paid.",4
65477,very informative course!! Coursera should have more fashion related courses,4
50728,"It's a decent enough introductory course. Not amazing, and I have to admit I might be biased by the fact that I already knew much of the material beforehand, but I enjoyed taking it.",4
106674,very good course.,4
18879,The course is really helpful,4
20289,"I do love the content of this course, however I do wish we saw more scenarios play out when trying to get a point across. This course is just harder to obtain for me memory wise.",4
69643,"Overall this course is really helpful when it comes to grammar and sentence structuring. You get experience with a lot of vocabulary as well. I gave the course four stars because Chinese characters aren't taught or covered at all, just pinyin. Which is fine, but it would be nice to have those briefly introduced as well.",4
26262,I enjoyed the html and css portion of the cs but the java script portion is not for beginners.,4
65217,"Very good, the lectures are straightforward and the material is understandable and well-explained.",4
94999,Great course! Some of the homework questions seemed a little ambiguous but I was able to find clarification in the course discussion. All in all I learned a lot.,4
9898,"Took the free version of this course to learn some basic building blocks of Android app dev and to dive back into programming, already having Java knowledge from long ago. For my purposes it was a good intro. For a totally new coder this might not be best as there isn't deep explanation of the code itself. But for the rest, it allows you to quickly dive in.",4
44959,"A very interesting course, with the material given in a simple and clear way for everyone to understand.",4
8733,good clarity,4
16615,Great Course and Instructors!Only think i didn't like is the peer grading system as many of the users grade low without any reason!,4
7626,"This is a very clear and very well presented course. It covers the science of nutrition as well as the practical aspects of cooking through demos. The instructor speaks clearly and knowledgeably about her subject.I will note that it is definitely a beginner level course. If you already do a fair bit of cooking from scratch and have already read some Michael Pollan books, you may not learn much that is new to you.What it does though, it does very well.Also, the instructor's kitchen is beautiful and I spent most of the lectures coveting it greatly :)",4
68497,"Nicely structured and overall a great course. Sometimes a little slow, for my preference.",4
6227,The problem sets are like real life problems and the lecture focuses on what are the most confusing parts. It is a valuable course for someone who has just a little computer programming background to start one's journey with C language.,4
102837,This is so useful for network communications and mobile communications as well,4
35350,"I thought this course was mostly very well done. I would love to get in touch with the professor who created the course, and may try to reach out via other means. I am a transgender grad student at Mills College working on gender inclusive early childhood education.One note specifically for Coursera, though... The honor code validation use of ""legal name"" on a course about transgender rights/health poses a particular emotional barrier for transgender people taking the course. Many transgender people go by names that are not their legal name and may or may not be able to change their legal names due to complicated laws and requirements. Having folks sign using their legal name is a potentially hostile, if relatively passive, act towards some transgender folks taking this class.",4
8538,So much better than in the first version of the specialization! the peer reviewed project is a welcome addition to help understanding map reduce concepts,4
40315,Very detailed and structured content. Is it possible to get printable content as well along with videos?,4
78005,Very easy and easy to understand,4
67792,Good analysis of MSW practices in developing countries,4
32474,"It is a great course, really interesting, really easy to complete though some of the topics are a bit challenging. Overall a great achievement to finish this course. (Although I didn't receive a certificate but at least I finished the course)",4
27214,"Loving this course so far! Fairly in-depth, yet still easy to follow. Lecturer is easy on the ears and keeps one captivated",4
24587,Very good introduction into the field. Peer reviewed assignment could be better,4
4740,"This good course; but I have none of those cards, as I can do to pay the course",4
79970,Helpful and good introduction to get start on projects management.,4
30503,Great! Thanks,4
96224,"Thank you!Some of the exercises were not that well explained, but with the help of the forum everything was doable.",4
106296,Good survey of techniques,4
4158,Interesting approach for teachers and those involved in any type of learning processes. Useful reading material,4
99435,I would give 5 stars if the pace was not so fast... week 5 especially have large amount of information to process compressed in short period of time.,4
22731,The teacher is great and the subject is very interesting,4
78829,everything is fine but the music before each lecture is so loud and annoying,4
68988,The content and articulation was excellent. Inspired and motivated me to continue the course in spite of my struggle to understand certain concepts. There are lot more statisticians out there who are heaps better than myself and it was excellent experience to read the questions and answers in the discussion forum. Will continue the course and get my certification and enroll for capstone project as well.,4
59678,"It is very suitable for those who have no background involving machine learning, this lecture is very basic but practical and essential.",4
62064,A good informative course. Very useful and futuristic,4
74046,"I go to learn lot of programming concept, the instructor was very involved in the course. Thank you.",4
33095,"I enjoyed the pace of this class however, I was not too keen on the way code is graded, e.g. for the final project of the 3rd week, although my code validated and the resulting page was identical to the instructor's mockup, it was still marked incorrect in the quiz and there was no way to determine exactly what the issue was. There has to be a better way to grade coding assignments.",4
42515,"Good paced, with very interesting material. Learned both new ideas and also understood older ideas that i didn't quite have a good explanation for. Thanks for a great course.",4
2741,"Fairly well presented in that different points of view on the questions were put forward. I found it interesting and informative to learn how better to choose compare and charities.Unfortunately there seems to be a dominate premise. That is this course insists one must give up the maximum part of ones income to 'charities' who will do the job to help others for you. In this I disagree and have not changed fundamentally in my perception.Having said that, one does come away with more motivation to think about and to act more altruistically as the occasions present themselves.",4
62744,thanks for your dedicated effort,4
6291,It's fun and understandable,4
92086,"Great course and additional materials. The last week seemed a bit too far away from the previous one, though. Still it was manageable and understandable, Thanks.",4
67240,"I really like this course. Geoffrey Hinton is one of the very best researchers in Neural Networks in the world. I gave it 4 stars (instead of 5) for substandard implementation of its tests (misaligned questions and missing question content) and programming exercises (missing supporting documentation and code). I was able to get through this problems by googling it, but this was frustrating. Once this problems are sorted out, this course will be really enjoyable.",4
5225,"Despite some error in the quizzes I learned quite a lot by taking this online course. Apparently the course organisers are overwhelmed by its success, since they react (too) slowly to comments made by students in the discussion fora. At least, errors should be tackled immediately.",4
34193,It is a good course for those who want to be a entrepreneur but don't really know what that means. The course gives a lot to think about and consider when opening a business. It is also a quick and easy to learn course.,4
34455,"Good course, learnt a few new things even though I am very experienced with Excel. I found some of the exercise / project questions a bit confusing (not the task itself, but the way it was described - instructions were not always clear, and sometimes contained errors).",4
17767,"While to introductory, yet very good.",4
39267,Good cours,4
59552,"good material but sound quality of videos is bad, could use his own machine learning techniques to improve the sound, also no literature which is bad.",4
8115,"As a college student I really appreciate how many of the tips shared are simple and can be implemented on a day to day basis. A lot the recipes and ideas shared do not require really fancy equipment or ingredients I've never heard of, are super expensive, or hard to find. The instructor truly cares about students leaning how to cook for themselves and eat healthier and provides information to do so without judgement. Her passion is clear and I love how she promotes little steps and not some drastic change that can eat up all of your energy and focus to implement. Thank you!!!!",4
17673,Very good and brief overview of the topic.,4
5509,Very informative for expanding my skills and terminology.,4
95525,"Thank you Mike, for providing such a Course! When I looked for Courses on corporate sustainability, I found less than expected. Hence, being happy to have found this. I really enjoyed the Course and I strongly recommend it. And for someone who had already dealt with this Topic before the Course, the Content could have been Little more detailed and comprehensive. But since the Course addresses not only People who deal with the Topic on a regular Basis, obviously it is understandable why it is designed like that.",4
80003,Refurbish your project management knowledge.,4
13627,"As a beginning and inspiring writer, this course is a fundamental stepping stone.",4
48907,Good course on communication strategies using VOIP which will be useful for the Capstone project.,4
9349,"The content of this course is fantastic, if you read the textbook with it. It would be 5 stars, but there are a number of glitches in the quizzes and exams. Information about the textbook and quiz issues can be found in the first post on the discussion board.",4
89214,Learned something new in this course. I appreciate that.,4
98966,Quick and easy to understand lectures. I was able to pick up active record and action pack quickly!,4
62680,"It an amazing start and i really admire Julie and Professor for putting so much of effort in creating the course in a super structured way , I taking the further modules since i liked the opening so much.",4
100632,"Very informative, I had a bit of trouble with notetaking though, sometimes info you needed was all over the place, alot of stop and rewind but still a good course",4
33020,It gives the basic of the basic of HTML5. I would recommend to either merge this course with other courses that have more about web stuff or to add some JS stuff to the course,4
64489,This course is awesome. It teaches from the ground and easy to understand all the contents.It helps to build up concept and is very helpful for further detail study in the same topic .,4
72578,Good to have deep insight into regression and various popular algorithm,4
226,"This is an excellent course, especially for someone with near zero knowledge of financial statements and their analysis. The concepts are clearly presented, with interesting details and supporting examples of their use. The inane comments by cartoon characters using poorly simulated accents is only mildly irritating.",4
14030,"It was good - I think I would like a bit more on Github, but it gets covered in other courses. It shall have more material on the coverage of data science.",4
103687,I found this course enjoyable and easy to follow along with.,4
25210,Week 3 wasn't taught well. And the assignment was too difficult. Other weeks were fine.,4
86467,There's in a change in the way of presenting the course. I prefer the previous 2 section though.,4
85921,"Good, could be better.",4
86110,"Very worth learning.Introduced the basic concepts of project management in system, benefit a lot from this course.",4
88282,"This was a good introduction to the principles and concepts of project management. I completed this course as part of professional development for my current job, and learned some good terminology and best practices. If you have experience with project management or want to learn more advanced concepts, I imagine this course would not be for you. If you're looking for a good introduction to project management that you can build on later, this is a good place to start.",4
104027,"Good explanation of concepts, would be better if add more interaction",4
47796,"At 51 years old I have learned there is much more to learning, more of an efficient skill and methodology , than a drawn out complex process. Thank you, Charles.",4
23669,very helpful,4
76109,Good to start off newly. But I think an certificate of completion must have been issued after completing the course for those taking the free course,4
3941,I found this to be very useful in getting started with both C and the Arduino - neither of which I've studied/used before. I felt the lectures were well delivered and the videos of the Arduino board and circuit helped me to connect components correctly. I suspect some of the problems I experienced in submitting my projects might be resolved through some more detailed advice within the course notes. I'm looking forward very much to the companion course involving interfacing with the Arduino.,4
66906,"Very good course, very bad accent:) even being Russian I could hardly understand sometimes",4
90787,"Not for the faint of heart as you are expected to be (somewhat) up-to-date on derivatives and primitives for position, velocity, and acceleration. However, even with a minimum background in mathematics and a healthy dose of determination it is possible to succeed in this course. Do not expect it to be easy but really worthwhile if one is interested in quadrotors and ""what makes them fly"".",4
65692,I think everyone should take this course although some of the lectures are hard,4
18473,"It is pretty fast paced, I wish there was more studymaterial to help prepare you for the quizzes.",4
40014,good course. professor tries to sell his book too much. it's emba,4
31681,"I know that it would be near impossible to do this on a website like Coursera where thousands of people are probably enrolled in your course, but it would be great if there was some real evaluation (teachers or experienced alums to comment on the quality) of our essays/responses.",4
10114,interesting practices with neo4j,4
34441,"GREAT, COMPREHENSIVE",4
15193,Well. I don't think this could be categorized as a course. You can think of it as table of content for the specialization.,4
19980,Covered a great deal of ground in a short period of time. Heavy economics.,4
92471,The lectures were really good. I am a microbiologist and have very little background of computer programming. A more detailed course would have he,4
32413,"Very good, connected also to relatively recent outbreaks. Maybe some miniquiz/few question after each block would be nice to sum it up and help with preparing for quiz after whole week.",4
69044,A good introduction to machine learning,4
1925,"Great to learn about cash flow, both positive and negative. Makes sense, a course for the real world.",4
65933,"I think there is not enough scientific facts, I expected some more information about the molecular basis of Alzheimer disease and memory in general. However, I enjoyed the course and I would recommend it, it is very good explained and through the movies you can feel aproximately what these people feel.",4
39781,"I learned a lot about *how* the internet works, which makes this course totally worth the time I spent on it.",4
77764,thanks a lot,4
66912,Great course!!!!,4
16722,Great Course. Awesome Content. The sessions can be a little more interactive.,4
67360,"This course was too biologically technical, but I loved it. From a marketer's point of view, there was such amazing information on consumer behaviour.",4
32268,"The course is very practical, and gives many great every-day tools for understanding how things work. Nevertheless, I feel it lacks mathematical references. For example, I would like to see proofs, examples with actual numbers and etc.",4
12032,"This course is a very good introduction to blockchain technology and popular in nowadays Bitcoin currency. However the main disadvantages are assigments which are hard to accomplished because there aren't any tests attached, so you cannot check on your computer whether your solution is good or not and you cannot debug your code to find an issue if it isn't ;)",4
2693,"This course was great for me. I was looking for a refresher course since I had some Android experience, but due to different career path I have not used in about 4 years. It was good for me.",4
23339,"This course was great for an introductory course to food and health because it emphasized getting back to the basics of real food and cooking simply. It lost a star because I felt like there were certain topics that needed a more in depth and less cursory approach. They were almost dismissive at times for the sake of ""keeping it simple"" whereas a simple suggestion about washing produce to remove pesticides could've been helpful.",4
19728,"Very good course and complete... Best Regards,",4
36163,"The course was extremely interesting, it helped me a lot in general about how markets operate, and how they are interlinked within the economy. The course would have been more fruitful if more numerical examples and explanations were given in lectures.",4
96681,I Learnt a lot. Thank you,4
20679,very good first step to public health,4
14122,Very basic. I am hoping it helps guide my time commitment for further classes.,4
8180,"This Course is great for beginners, and it helped to improve my English considerably.",4
34821,"Well constructed, excellent course. Learned a lot.",4
101741,This is a an extremely helpful course. Just having an idea and how to actually step by step execute it was very well taught and having to do each assignment on your own and experiencing it was a great learning as well.,4
94715,I found this course gave me great tools to improve my classes. Being a teacher is not something easy but with practice and great professor like the ones in this course we sure can give better things to our students.,4
70850,"I quite appreciate the teaching of American philosophers, like Emerson or Rorty.",4
59143,Very good course!,4
43335,It is helpful but not deep enough in some concepts.,4
24721,The Fundamentals of Management is a good introduction into this area of knowledge.,4
102933,"I did learn a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and plan on learning more on my own. I enjoyed the course overall but felt like it should have been longer and more introductory for those of us who knew nothing about programing concepts.",4
3482,"Good introduction to AngularJS. Moreover their provide a wide variety of additional information related to the course, which is very useful to enlarge the basic contents studied.",4
105357,"Too complex lectures for novices, too easy assignments for experienced python programmers.",4
47635,Just started and like a lot the hands on approach and tools provided,4
37393,Good basic foundation of HTML and CSS.It will help if the grading rubric needs to be more flexible in order to assess smaller outcomes. I found it too binary to be of use for accurate assessment.,4
50766,The material presented laid a strong basic foundation for future courses. I feel as a new Product Manager I will be able to apply lessons learned in real life situations.,4
37334,"Gives a great overview, though a bit more depth and content would have been great. Still, overall a great course for beginners!",4
8338,Nice to get this course.,4
67636,Very interesting!,4
62480,it helps me to know what are the latest advances in the digital world and how that change the marketing four p's,4
61862,"Good intro to plotting, charting and visualization in Python. Focuses mainly on matplotlib. I feel good about the content that I learned, but also feel like I wanted to learn more in this class. Maybe more coverage of other python charting libraries. More examples of financial type charts -- High/Low/Open/Close etc.",4
100167,Basic information provided. Very interesting material on the last module. This course is for someone that has never taken a time management course.,4
91779,"Teacher was good, but the hand in assignments were much too simple. They didn't challenge me, and I didn't really get to practice the new things we've learned. All assignments were just about copy/paste 3-4 lines in existing code, and make a minor change to it.",4
102046,Awesome course. Exams could have been a little tough to pass....,4
32105,"A great course, it contains very broad discussion of the problems of linguistics.Quite demanding quizes force students to watch videos carefully and to read the required reading. This leads to better understanding of the matter.The videos in the course are great too, the explanation of prof. Oostendorp is very lively and entertaining. The interviews with specialists are unique.",4
18247,"way to beginner, felt it could've gone a bit more in depth coming from a known university such as Duke.",4
62252,"Very simple. Almost too simple. Fortunately, this seems to be an intro course, as the next courses in the specialization are much more specific with better content.",4
49506,Nice Introductory course,4
83893,"this is a reaally good course, you can increase your python playground and knowledge using what you have learnt in Course 1 but you can also deal with more difficult types, functions, probems etc.I think that the most useful aim is to connect new arguments (like new types) with what you have already learnt trying to find a solution for more difficult problems",4
7451,"I really liked this course. It has given me a renewed appreciation for home cooking. My favorite part was the hand drawings for the main content videos. I also liked all the cooking demonstrations. I plan on trying them real soon In the future, I'm hoping for more content and the opportunity to earn a certificate. I'd like to see a section specific nutritional targets for certain age groups. Menu planning would also be welcome.",4
51145,"great info,friendly staff and very easy to understand",4
25597,"Very good course, allows you to actually ""think"" and implement a game, which I love.Only issue is the grading. I would change the name of the scoring, makes it easy for people to give bad grades.",4
23359,"Very informative course, which has encouraged me to research the topic further and to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Based on my research, however, I believe a mistake might have been made. According to the instructional material, the only group of essential fatty acids is omega-3. Based on my research, however, essential fatty acids include ALA, an omega-3 fatty acid, and LA, which is an omega-6 fatty acid.",4
103893,Nice easy introduction. If you've already got a programming background.,4
680,It's very usefull course,4
95329,It's really nice to learn pandas in this courses. Every assignment is full of challenge for me.,4
20539,I want to give 4 stars because this course teaches you many concepts in a short time. In a very understandable way.,4
36566,"Even though the course is a bit theoretical especially the assignments, it can be decent start for a beginner. I wish the topics weren't so scattered as it was getting difficult for all the knowledge to set in.",4
98526,"Very enthusiastic lecturer, which made learning that much more enjoyable! The course content is fantastic. My only comment is the grading system for the assignments / how the assignments are designed - in my opinion the grading system could be improved to reflect efforts and correct submission done by students.",4
95698,Very good and wide ranging performances. The insights were interesting.,4
12023,Extremely good course. Only drawback is that the assignments cannot really be checked independently.,4
67169,"A great course to learn.Some quiz are broken, check forums often for that.",4
22729,Very helpful for non-financial professionals. The course is too short for me. I'd like to get further knowledge about the finance. Thanks very much for your impressive work.,4
8805,A good brush up and clear information. A bit basic for me personally. This should be stated more clearly.,4
64138,So far this has been a very interesting course.,4

38671,"Learn Java first, as they go through it at an agile pace.",4
11153,Good course. I would like it better if there are more depth in theories and analysis/examples used in lectures are more reflecting social media and the use of more cutting edge innovation in communication technology.,4
29620,Very good for beginners in essay writing.Thank you.,4
46446,"Some useful points, however I wish they taught the class more generally. The focus on classes and exams tests isn't as useful after you've finished school.",4

42011,very practical and vocational course. I reccomend it!,4
64517,"Actually, I think that information is incredibly relevant, but I need more examples - as simplified as possible - in lectures",4
39411,It is a comprehensive one covering breadth of IoT and related concepts,4
87951,Repetitive. I already sent this type of course five years ago in college.,4
77111,"A bit too easy for a person who has used python a bit before. Otherwise, fun and interesting.",4
3867,"Had joined for free(non-specialization), it was good. Got a basic overview on ardunio. I had never worked on ardunio, but on AVR microcontroller. If you are looking for basic overview, its really good. Thanks to coursera :)",4

2489,"Both Challenging & rewarding, taught me basics of Tableau, viz and comms.",4
58845,The course content was excellent. Only drawback was voice recording quality.,4
10886,"After finishing week one I am inclined to say that the course is compared to other courses labour intensive. The content is consistent, well structured and up to the point. However, the level of English of nearly all speakers is more than poor. Most of the lectures are read of the paper. The subtitles do not help to mitigate misunderstandings resulting from the poor language. Instead, it magnifies the problem (e.g. naming the ""PISA-test"" as ""pizza""). Also the power-point slides hold many mistakes, e.g. in the formatting. Even the quiz questions are not free of mistakes and are misleading or grammatically incorrect or even hold incomplete sentences. Very annoying. Overall, the finalizing of the course was not done with due diligence.",4
37319,"Well taught course but the material for the homework assignments were basically given to us. The answers were handed to us in the homework description. Having said this, the assignments were good. One should have basic program",4

80801,Very interesting course and useful tools for negotiation.,4
57025,"Great introductory course to machine learning. There were some quirks to workout in the assignments and the course could use a refresh to make it more current (content is from 2011, I think).

For example, dealing with a death, mass shootings, terrorist attacks, more natural disasters like earthquakes or tornados, and even abuse.

96196,awesome course with very good practice but explanation need to be more enthusiastic,4
25564,"This is a great course, if you want to hear The Questions you need to Answer to make a good game design for your game. It does not give you the answers, but it gives you a road map to follow.Downside of the course are Quizes and Peer Reviews. Quizes sometimes have shady and non-clear answers, especially for non-native English speakers. Assignments grading criteria makes your peers to choose from 1 to 5. And 5 is ""you did so awesome, that you've impressed your peer very much"". And this is not happening often.",4

47082,This is an amazing course. Everbody should take it.,4
101320,"This was a very informative course. I personally would have liked the course to be a bit more intensive on the math side, but I can understand that the entire target audience may not necessarily feel the same. I think that the course could have gone in depth for other kind of models such a monte carlo, markov chains, probability trees as well. Apart from that the course was quite good.",4
64957,"A very good basic introduction to Ancient Egypt. But, if you have already taken a similar course or read several books on the topic, you won't find anything new. The instructor knows his stuff but doesn't seem very passionate or engaging.",4
18885,Very good at explaining design principles and to get the students thinking of making simple visualizations that convey a story.,4
69746,I thought the class was very well done as an introductory class. Although I thought there would be an introduction to characters also. I liked the laoshi and the slides. :),4
86873,The lectures are very good. I would recommend that more examples be added in the book. This will help students solve problems and understand the concepts better.,4
40797,"Most useful content is the list of factors that influence us behind the scenes in our minds. Would prefer to have more content of that nature presented, since the concepts of power and how to use those behind the scenes influences seem fairly basic in comparison. I appreciated the succinct presentation of the material, as well. Please make your graphics/slides available.",4
20271,it is perfect course i take it until now thank you,4
6557,"All right, this is not a very ""easy to follow"" course. But it's such a great opportunity to deeply study the subject with great specialists and meditation practitioners : how lucky we are ! By going slowly, step by step, being aware that I do not understand everything at once, I'm all right, convinced I'm learning a lot, from both an academic and personal point of view.",4
60245,The course contains some fundamental concepts of machine learning. It is not very hard to accomplish the course.,4

10122,"Overall I really enjoyed this course, and I think I learned a lot, so thank you!However I think there were some things that could be improved.Firstly the quality of the code provided for the programming assignment was very low. It contains a lot of things that are far from modern c++ best-practices (e.g. using raw arrays instead of std::vector, mixing malloc and new, using new where there is no reason to use it, using raw pointers when references would be fine, missing consts, macros, ...). There were also some relatively minor bugs: the first log message doesn't print with the correct prefix, and the grading script as provided doesn't run (IIRC it was because the #! isn't on the first line). Since this course could be some people's first introduction to C++ I feel that it's important to set a good example, and to keep the code simple and safe.Secondly the symbols used for things were often inconsistent between slides, which was occasionally confusing but should be easy to fix.Despite these issues I still think this is a great course, it just could be a little bit better.",4
53119,"Very insightfull, but gets redundant in the end (last 2-3 Courses)",4
34505,Good Intermediate level course. Including useful functions we experience being part of Finance profile. Thanks,4
32800,"Comprehensive. You get a firm idea about the direction about the upcoming green urban wave. However, could do with more practical specifics rather than just ideas and guidelines.",4
92555,"Theory and practical knowledge. Very useful and insightful, especially if you're interested to learn about business, strategic management, and innovation.",4
91434,"It is very good, but a little short on detailed information.",4
92024,"Topics covered are great, but there is a lack of assignments to be done by students completely on themselves.",4
41469,"As usual the 4 professors(presenters) have done an excellent job. The resources, videos, assignments and quizzes are very helpful, well thought out and comprehensive. They have done an enormous amount of work.But there seem to be problems with the import edu.duke.* due to installation problems (e.g. Windows 10).Maybe include 3 videos like:( example from other Coursera courses e.g. R Programming)Installing BlueJ on a MacInstalling BlueJ on WindowsInstalling Bluej on (Mac) ; including these would enable me to give a rating of 5 stars.For the beginner programmer this would help a lot.I know there is the Discussions forum (very helpful) and students must sweat a bit to get BlueJ to work on some messy Operating Systems but this is my comment as a Beta Tester",4
60194,I am really enjoying this course. It's a fun mix of my programming skills and math interests. I Strongly recommend taking Sal Kahn's course on Linear Algebra (@ Khanacademy) or having some Linear Algebra background before taking this course.,4

10421,Repeating slides,4
67513,"I am taking all courses in the specialization, and this is my fourth. I have been having a great time with materials by both instructors so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-existent. The first section is fine, but starting from ""Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling,"" for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from learners that narrowly targets the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem. If it is the latter, perhaps it is time to redesign the lessons of this week.",4
48273,Very useful learning tips and tricks.,4
75215,"Great intro to python, thanks.",4
12929,More reading on my own than I expected but great class overall.,4
103879,"I liked it, everything is well described, clear and helpful.The last assignment description is not clear. The Peer Review reviewing criteria is not clear as well. It could be understood by many ways. They should enhance the peer review instructions.",4
45048,"A very helpful course, done in a fun way.",4
9381,Great course! Everything is explained extremely clearly. The only 'missing star' here is that some of the final quizzes reject the correct answer due to a technical issue.,4

75636,"very interesting and challenging, though the mentors were very quick to respond to queries! thank you.",4
3697,Need a discussion forum.,4
19313,This course was a good use of time for me as I didn’t have much back ground in music theory.I now know how to construct a major and minor scale with any root. I’m also able to use those scales to build a number of chords to help guide improvisation.I found the ear training exercises to be a fun way to develop my musical awareness. I found them a little annoying because when I would go back to try them again my answers from the day before were still there.,4
21070,"As a seasoned teacher, 20 years, much of this content is intuitive or has already been in place in my classroom. The course validated much of the methodology I already use, but I did lose interest from time to time.",4
62364,"Wonderfully designed course. Great insights about co-creation, pwyw and other concepts. Thanks to the instructor for wonderful exercises. They were really relevant.",4
14375,I would've liked some practical assignments on using Git/Github.,4
71418,"The material was fantastic, but the lectures seemed to be a bit basic in comparison to the actual coding assignments. Even after understanding the martial covered in the lectures it felt at times as if the coding assignments were drafted against an entirely unrelated topic (or at least by someone with a completely different approach).",4
8457,A great introduction,4
61044,Comprehensive. But some terms are aligned to the US and European economy. But I still had a good time learning about the basics.,4
99868,"Simple and easy tips and a very short course. Thanks to the teacher, the university and Coursera for this course.:)",4
80353,"This is a very dense course, offering a quite detailed information and technique on negotiation. While the focus is very much on business deal negotiations, one can pick up transferable skills to apply in other areas. While the knowledge gained through this course is not directly applicable in my area of work, it is a useful course to have taken.",4

54547,Background details missing but overall fantastic experience.... :),4
67289,Completed a Course which truly speaking was about Demystifying Mindfulness. The Course is different from the other MOOCS in the sense that you have hands on practical sessions in the Meditation Labs of the Univrrsity.,4
66673,"Great course! I did my undergrad at the Eastman School of Music, yet there is still so much more to learn. Although not as comprehensive or involved as a college course (I was never able to view peer graders' comments to my projects even though I did quite well on them), this course taught me that the possibilities as a musician are limitless with technology. The more I learn the less I feel I know. I am intensely curious about Music Technology now. Thank you Jason Freeman!",4
22341,I have lear,4
59950,Bit technical. Totally worth it.,4

65819,Informative and illustrated how some quant concepts are put in practical use. Thank you.,4
81680,The course was a bit too basic... I was hoping for slightly more difficult / comprehensive assignments.,4
21714,In a clear and easy-to-understand way to introduce the basic concept and major functions of the EU. Very useful and practical for the real life.,4
62186,Useful information for an introductory course to Digital Marketing. Study cases are interesting and engaging! Some topics are more related to IT than marketing itself. Would be great to update some of the reading resources since they are from 2012.,4
55788,Further specific mathematical proof should be needed.,4
61455,Interesting course and good basic knowledge! I wish we had more practice though.,4
36553,It is a general course for non-specialist in finance.,4
19141,"Difficult subject to get your head around but ultimately worth the effort. The teaching, as always with the University of Alberta's MOOCs, is second to none.",4
102848,Good general overview. Only wish it was longer and could cover material in more detail.,4
15352,"The content is easy to follow and is clearly explained without adding unnecessary complexity at this entry level. This specialization reaches its goals. Instead of trying to over achieve it keeps things simple.I would recommend taking the ""Data Science Specialization"" as the next step.",4
88780,"Fun, informative course that doesn't take too much time. I would suggest it for people who are new to learning Philosophy, because it may be too simple for people with a decent knowledge of philosophy.",4
70310,"A good course. The user of unfolding maps makes it a little confusing at times, but on the positive side it provides and example that could be of practical use when creating programs in future.",4
20378,"Enjoyed learning about the different statuates and policies as well as how to read them. From those not from US and fear that the stuff learnt may not be as relevant, don't fret! What's introduced are major policies that are important to the global community!",4
38686,Good course!!. the approach is well-balanced (no superficial and at the same time not too much professional). The quiz are done very well.,4
81117,This course is very well structured and provides an overall glimpse of the vast field of Macro Economics.,4
93932,useful to learn about the most common sanitation technologies,4
100777,"I would give this course a five based on the content it provides, but it lacks in three key areas. First, no forums, really? This is how we learn when we have NO instructor or TA support. They also lack workable calculations. Second, there was a GLARING error in a quiz that no one caught, showing a near complete lack of understanding of energy conversion. Third, the quiz engine has had a number of errors in the calculations. specifically in formula formatting. These are advanced systems that clearly need more testing. But all in all, this is GREAT content if you want to learn about organic (polymer OPV) solar cells.",4
21951,"Honestly, I wanted to give complete 5 rating to this course, because the content of the lecture is well explained. But one feature I didn't like at all and that is Coursera has made it mandatory for the users to purchase the course in order to submit the quiz/assignment which I personally didn't like it. Except that the course is awesome.",4
81592,a good scientific course from one of the leaders of positive pscyhology. explains many key scientific evidences for happiness and positivity. good for curious learners. the course is free.,4
58902,"Prof Andrew Ng did an extremely amazing job, he took the effort to not leave out even many obvious details. He ensured everyone was following the course, and the course itself has covered many aspects of supervised learning etc. It works as a great introductory course for someone who is new to the paradigm and would be the first step if someone is interested in pursuing research interests in the field",4
19322,Cannot do the test without pay...,4
18564,Good but I think the java script they jump into very advanced stuff if you have never code before.,4
72911,Very Helpful! But maybe when an experienced lecturer grades the assignments it will make a difference.,4
60409,"It was very informative. The instructor needs to slow down just a little though, I could tell he's a little nervous speaking to ""large groups"". Otherwise, it was great. I'm from BAWA and I am familiar with and love JHU, so I support any great course coming from there.",4
1194,A really great course!!,4
17475,"This class was pretty good. I liked the reading assignments, and there was some helpful instruction as well. I liked learning about the second person perspective, and the section on credibility and research was also really helpful.",4
11465,It's a good course if you want a general overview of the statistics of clinical research. Personally I was hoping for a little more depth in some of the statistical methods. Some links or suggested readings on the methods would be great as we move along the course. Overall a delightful course. Everything is clearly explained. Thank you Dr. Koppler!,4
6366,I really learned things from this coarse which I would not learn it easily from life .,4
54302,It's good and informative,4
49617,"very happy with this course,way of teaching was very understandable and nice.",4
102050,"this is very basic and clear about social. it helps me understand about the fielf of social marketing, some concepts, such as social network, virtual community and characteristics of these are essential for making social plan.the exercise seems easy but practical, it is good first step for leaning social marketing. hope to learn next course",4
47053,Course is great. I have one complaint though. Mind mapping is absolutely a brilliant technique but only when done at the end of studying a subject trying to fit together all the pieces.,4
46591,"Well paced, good tips, interesting psychological ideas throughout. I think this will help me in a real and practical way. Thanks!",4
75909,This course progresses extremely slowly but it covers the material as advertised. I recommend this to absolute programming beginners.,4

95787,A very useful course!,4

44914,A very interesting course! Recommend to all of you!,4
80515,nice course worth learning,4
104834,Probably more math than required at this stage,4
100311,"A little bit short, but very full of interesting cues and tips. The course resources and articles are very useful too.",4
95299,"The course is challenging, and designed to encourage learners to be independent and make full use of the discussion forum. As long as learners do not lose sight of the fact that help is available, they will enjoy this course. But if they lose faith, this would be a disaster.",4
99903,Precise and good advices for practical uses.,4
1237,Great,4
67168,"Excellent material! Amazing to learn with one of the developers of NN.Unfortunately, there were lots of errors in the Quizzes and Assignments. Several questions could be answered only thanks to the help of other students that have had access to previous versions of the course.The mentors were at the beginning answering questions from the students that completed the course in the first couple of weeks and later disappeared. Then it was clearly in autopilot.Anyway, positive!It is necessary more hands on exercises to tight the theory with the practice.",4
36162,Interesting approach.,4
38269,Contents where we are referring to the statistics of 2012 should be updated.,4
73202,"This course has been enlightening and enriching for me in terms of how governance works in America. The issues raised can be applicable to many other countries in the world. However, this is not the course for you if you are looking for theoretical and analytical skills as this course is structured around sharings and exchanges with public figures about the current and future agenda of the US. (This is just my personal opinion and others may disagree me with me on certain aspects.)",4
94380,A good introductory course for people who has an interest in knowing the principles of machine learning and want to make a step forward. Sufficient details covered throughout the course and additional resources were provided which are very useful. Quizzes were well designed with minor improvements in the accidental mismatch of the answers due to package version issues. Overall the study experience was enjoyable and would definitely recommend to someone who wants to start knowing data science.,4
18929,"Overall the course content and quality is good and the lectures are pretty good and highly informative, but the course content need to be highly practical oriented and geared towards meeting the real-time needs of digital marketing professionals.",4

68100,"Good intro to ML, but would've enjoyed less of the ""Black Box"" approach in using Graphlab.",4
62698,"Interesting course, especially for the people who are planning to do their further studies in Marketing, (Post graduation/ Phd)",4
277,Content very clear and explained by the professors.,4
92956,"I think it was a good course, but the examples are basic while the assesments were pretty hard. Maybe it'd be splitted in two different courses.",4
79228,This course gives you better insights in Problem-solving and the tools to measure this.,4
20411,This course was well organized and highlighted the most influential environmental law cases in the US. It would be great if the course could be updated to reflect the recent COP21-Paris Agreement,4
7304,"The material given is good for an introductory course on child nutrition. The graphics and didactic material is very good. I would suggest that Dr. Maya improve on her cooking skills (cutting and chopping), It takes too long to do every task and she must use appropriate tools. also, measurements are very important in the kitchen to be disregarded as she does. Remember, she might be teaching to people that have not cook at all. Cooking without measuring is for an expert or a least for somebody with some cooking experience.",4
73402,"in this course programme ,concepts have been explained very well",4

43608,"I really enjoyed this course. Barbara Oakley was brilliant and explains things very clearly. Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, however, was incredibly difficult to listen to. His speech didn't flow and that made it hard to follow what he was saying.",4
62899,"A great refresher course for math. Depending on which way you look at the course it is either 4 or 5 stars, I wish I could give 4.5 for this reason! I'm not sure if it would be wholly sufficient for people new to mathematics trying to get into business/MBA as there needs to be more examples and problem sets. There could also be some PDFs added to further reinforce learning. However I still rate this course highly because I had no experience with matrices but through the videos as a sole resource I got a perfect score on the quiz on the first time. If you have a maths background you'll find this course the perfect refresher for exploring your MBA options.",4

87765,Dr Chuck - a computing professor with a sense of humour - won me over in the end. This doesn't ask too much. It's clearly set out and you get to have a little go at programming at the end of each session. This course highlights how easy Python is more than anything and that's a good thing. Good coding language for beginners. Good course for beginners or novices.,4

98120,"In this course, you can see HOW to start a school year by setting up the rules and practicing with your students at the beginning of a school year. Students would know teachers expectation and act accordingly by the rules, otherwise they would receive punishment. Involve students in setting class rules if possible. I learned a lot from this course.",4

81464,"This is a nice and easy course. The chat sessions were fun and interesting. The professor got me interested enough to continue on to Tibetan Meditation because she touched on some related topics. She tried to make it a worthwhile experience, which it was. There were good interviews and good supplemental material. This was very worthwhile. Its a positive touch when course leaders take the time to dress well and make a good visual impression, as they would in a ""real"" physical classroom. I think that positive psychology could be a slippery topic, hard to substantiate in a way, but it was a door opener for me. I felt like this was a fine introduction to this area of psychology, which, if understood correctly, is beginning to blossom.",4

97191,"This course helped me a lot to better understand the financial markets , and the different assets in which we can invest. The presentation was simple and clear in most of the modules. Maybe more examples and detailed description needed in company evaluation especially for students with moderate mathematical background. The module of Bonds needs -in my opinion - reconstruction so that we can read and understand the changes in Bonds' prices we find in the economical websites and newspapers. Anyway, the course is motivating to know more & extend our knowledge. Thanks a lot to all the professors and lecturers who prepared that course. Special thanks to Dr. Michelle and Dr. Ines for their attractive and simple approach. I recommend this course to all interested in investment management either for themselves or for professional purposes.",4

97106,"Course content has been very well designed to encompass all the major asset classes and impact of macro economic variables. While all of the topics covered deserve an individual course on itself, but this being a short-term online course, does great justice to the time and fee commitment from students.I would strongly recommend this course to others.Thanks to coursera for designing this course and the respected faculty members for their time and sharing insights into these topics with us.",4
34018,Professor Noor is very friendly and clear in his lectures. He also answers questions in the discussion foruns with speed and detail. I was able to learn a lot from this course and challenged myself to a heavier load of lectures than I had expected because they were not boring at all. My only caveat is that the questions in his quizzes can sometimes be unnecessarily confusing because of wording or tricks.,4
34958,"Really interesting and useful introduction to big data in healthcare. Big data in healthcare is on the verge of revolutionizing how we provide care in future while focusing on meaningful outcomes. This course provides you with a pretty decent background. The presentation itself is a little 'choppy' and heavy in informatics lingo, but the instructor does a great job and maintains interest. I will highly recommend this course to anyone who is 'curious' about big data in healthcare.",4
90442,quite redondant with what was done before but very usefull and clear course,4

97161,Quite informative for beginners.,4
553,"A course offering very accessible, clear introduction to the concept of programming seen as a network of algorithms, supplanted with a myriad of real-life examples. It then introduced a comely intuitive software, developed by MIT - Scratch, which enables you to practically start creating animations and thus programming. Even though i'm not a fluent hispano-hablante, just the knowledge of English and some classical culture should make it possible for you to follow. At the same time, should that be too complicated, there should be subtitles/English language version to all the videos and of all other materials. Have NOT tried that though.",4
34070,"Excellent introduction. However, there are flaws with the English subtitles",4
10338,"A course that provides an overview of the challenges faced by sustainable development efforts, and the processes the MAPS programme practices to effectively tackle them.

14152,It was a good introduction. Looking forward to the rest of the course.,4
105717,"Wonderful content and exposure to world data sources. The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars were some of the errors in quizzes scoring quesitons incorrectly--but overall, this was not a hinderance to learning and getting something out of the class.",4

64410,"good course but too much easy, can be a good review.",4
83239,"A well delivered, concise yet adequately comprehensive introduction to policy production.",4
35774,A very interesting course with a fascinating subject I've been intrigued by for a while. It gave me many skills and techniques to think about as I attempt to eventually become a historical fiction writer myself someday. My only negative critique is that I wish it dealt with the witches and medieval aspects of the course in the beginning rather than towards the end.,4
79404,This course was everything I thought it'd be. It was a simple and fast course to learn about personal branding and what you stand for as a leader.,4
9963,"very interesting!, i liked the stepik interactive lesson very much, i prefer them over lectures",4
58851,Great course but light on the mathematical part would love to get those insights.,4
94246,Great course. Only missing piece is the working information / maths behind the models. But as the name suggests it teaches practical approach towards machine learning.,4
57553,"Let me say that this is a great course and that I enjoyed it very much!My only problem is with the assignment that are, in my opinion, a bit limited and most of the time they focus on liner algebra implementations rather than give a better understanding of the algorithm.Most of the time the assignments focus on implementing a formula where the algorithm itself is already written for us.That is good as a first step but in the long run it doesn't give you some practical skills when you want to apply the algorithm to an external dataset.I would suggest to add some challenges (maybe ungraded) keggle style, like provided this dataset try to get a score better than a value. This will spark some discussion and it would help to apply the concepts and the practical tricks to a real (chewed) problem.",4
85572,"Good course, especially the doc and unit testing parts. I had hoped for a more advanced implementations, but thank you for mentioning the exec function.",4
67170,"Hinton is the reason we use neural nets today. He's advanced the theory and continues to explore new approaches. This is eye opening. He motivates the theory behind each approach he advances very well. Unfortunately, the practical side of the pedagogy of this course is not as strong. It is understandable to not turn this into a programming class. However, there is too much of a gap between even a clear explanation of theory and actual practice. This could be remedied with more hands on exercises (not necessarily coding, though coding is a fine way to test understanding.).",4
41570,"A good introductory course to gain an appreciation of some of the theory and techniques that goes into designing mechanical systems in our modern world. Real world cases are discussed, and I have become aware of some of the failure mechanisms in airplanes and in the body skeleton, so I am a bit more leary of taking airplane flights , and not jumping off high places while twirling. You need to be familiar with basic theory of stress and strain before taking this course, there is a series of courses available on Coursea as pre-requisite. The way the quizzes are scheduled makes it advantageous to watch the videos early in the week and take the quiz as soon as possible, since you get only one attempt every 24 hours. Enjoyed the course.",4
41084,"good course, really an introduction =)But the teacher is always reading a ""Teleprompter"".He is not spontaneous... Except when He uses RPG to demonstrate an example ;-)But the content is great",4
83135,"This course had a lot of depth to it, both in the lectures and the programming assignments. The last assignment seemed needlessly complex with not enough focus on the parallel programming aspect. I wish there had been more of a focus on how to actually write the parallel and task constructs which were instead given already implemented without much explanation.",4
89888,"Good intro, but not explaining many important principles, like variable scope, for example",4
16076,Great examples and perfect for learning the basics.,4
60420,Need more examples and real world scenarios,4
71328,"Excellent intro course, but not without issues.In general, pro's include reasonable length lectures, provided by _the_ leading expert in the field, and designer of the Scala language. Focus on functional programming techniques versus syntax nuance is a significant benefit - Scala is easy to get bogged down in. Pro's also include the fact that lectures have had at least some amount of post-production work done, and manage to make voiceover/slides/whiteboard consistent and coherent better than most similar online classes/tutorials.The assignments are reasonable, and the time estimates of ~3 hrs each was about right on the average, at least in my case (senior programmer with deep background in C/C++, and just enough Java to be dangerous and dislike boilerplate).Some drawbacks - there was no clear segue from ""basic syntax"" to ""collections framework"". That's _IMPORTANT_. In 20/20 hindsight, I would have benefitted from a big, bold slide before the first mention of ""foreach"" that said ""stop here, go to the text, and skim the chapters on collections for 'foreach' and other common operations. This is a building block for everything to follow, and NOT unique to just lists.""The major factor keeping this from being a '5' in my mind were that the assignments didn't always make sense as written, and I had to go back and forth between the assignment writeup, the source code and the test cases to really sort out what was required. The assignments could become _much_ more effective if they were provided with more test cases, including expected FAILURE cases and not just bare minimal acceptance cases.",4
37560,I want more practice,4
14599,This course provides very nice and useful tools for data analysis!,4
14460,"Well basically tutors only providing slides, speech, forums and ebook in this course...rest is self-learning, self-understanding, self-asking... if not, then you'll not pass this course i think..",4

90265,I truly enjoyed this course and I learned a lot. I particularly liked the structure and setup. My suggestions for improvement would be to provide more background information and further reading on the subjects covered and to maybe have a handout that summarizes the most important concepts and key messages of each week.,4
13443,Good and useful module.,4
80983,"I like it, overall. It can tax your mental capacity with an incoming stream of novel, technical vocabulary delivered vigorously by a knowledgeable teacher. It was hard to capture all without much time for reflection and making connections between pieces. I'd rather prefer dense slides and slower, simpler, big-picture oration.",4

59878,"Excellent course !Good choice of topics, great explanations, I liked that there are many practical tips.I would have liked: less guided programming exercises (the solution was almost given in the comments in the file to write) and larger (the student has to write only small bits of the overall project).I would also have liked recommended links or reading whenever a proof or an explanation of a mathematical result was skipped. I think the choice of what was skipped as too detailed for an intro was good, but would have been nice to have pointers for students who wanted to explore more.",4

100674,"Thanks you very much for teaching this course!You taught this course well. First, you introduced the vital principals of good writing. Second, you taught scaffolding, a useful tool to organise. Third, you taught techniques for revision. Lastly, you link course to design and presentation, a natural extension of writing in business world today (how i wish to go back to the old days when there are no presentations).I found the videos slightly too brief to let the idea or technique to sink in. This can be augmented by additional reading material. Also, to allow techniques become second nature, it will be even better if there are more exercises. A option to do more exercises can be a good idea. You can consider putting this into a book!by the way, my scaffold below lol-principals-scaffold-techniques for revision-it links to graphic design and presentation-more examples and practices",4

Also, not clear why diagrams can't be automated directly from the database programs e.g. Access.

Slow down. Practice.By week four the speakers in the audio files were speaking on a level where I was having difficulty distinguishing some of the words. In particular, the differences between the 20th and 21st of the month can be somewhat challenging for a beginning speaker of Korean. On the quizzes, I slowed down and repeated some of the audio.

5856,"Overall I like this course. The beginning of the course was very light and easy to follow. As the concepts got more in-depth, the weeks (namely 4 and 5) felt rushed and somewhat incomplete. Regardless, having never been exposed to this type of material, and for the price, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to get their feet wet with algorithms.",4
47233,"I think that diffuse the knowledges for free is a beautiful thing but i think also that i can learn quickly if i can learn also in my mother language because my englesh is not so good. I understand that also this is a way to speak a better english for me, but is possible that other students know already english language.",4
23365,Quite good for those in need of heathy living basics,4
40132,Great introduction to the specialization!,4
8770,"This is very good and I would recommend it, but it is quite short compared to other Coursera courses that I have paid for. I think they should add more content for the price they are charging.",4
45045,Good information. Very helpful. Could be more entertaining at some parts.,4
60954,it would be better if the course could offer more real life stories:) overall it is very inspiring.,4
90366,"Metrics produced a great opportunity to use exercises creating the software metric artifacts, as was done so well in course #4. This would be a significant improvement, and the lack of it was the only reason this didn't get five stars.",4
68708,"A good course, but I found the programming exercises fairly underwhelming. It is just an overview course, so it is what it is.",4
14045,Easy to follow overview.,4
6440,"I really like the subject of the course. The presentation was really good. However, some of the concepts were not so easy to understand. The course does not provide any reading, so I had to watch the lectures again if I forget some of the details. Eventually I've started taking detailed notes and added screenshots to my notebook. I wish I could have more exercises just for practice that would not be graded. That would provide a safe env. to learn and practice before taking final tests. Some of the answers to exercises were very helpful to learn the concepts better. So, more such practical exercises would be helpful.",4
49786,"Good course, the teacher is very good in explaining the subject",4
85539,"This course was a bit less exciting than two previous, maybe because of the topics discussed. But the instructor provided a lot of insightful ideas and practices. Would totaly recomend thios course for anyone interested in project management.",4
72983,Enjoyed the history of the typefaces,4
63821,Excellent course for anyone who wants to make sure their webpage works on different devices.,4
82234,An outstanding addition to your MBA education!,4
82111,"Well prepared lesson for those who has no background of coding. However, the topic is too wide to cover, so the depth of the lesson is not satisfying for those who already have some knowledge of coding.",4
100796,"The most valuable insight was at the end.We can be so focused on efficiency of solar conversion that we forget it is not the only factor in producing a useful product. I know this but the specific example embeds the insight to better use it in other situations.Overall the course gave a good overview, though it was a mixture of the very simple (calculations) and difficult (the explanation of the polymers) that needed more pointers to appropriate further reading.Useful to know that the effect of cell shadowing in the series cells has a small effect on output. I hope the project gets funding to continue the research.",4
85926,"Some more example, practical exercises would be nice to add.",4
80076,The course is a little bit hard to follow for the people who are just starting in the Project Management Area. It would be nice to have more video lessons and less additional material to consult.I liked the weekly exercises.,4
30633,"This course is really helpful especially for people wanting to write English articles better. The course outline is well laid out, videos are easy to understand, and exercises are very helpful for practicing your punctuation. The only negative point for me is how the teachers use a very strong American accent that some of the letters in a word are not pronounced anymore, like 'meanin' instead of 'meaning' and 'writin' instead of 'writing'. It doesn't really affect the teaching, though. All in all, this course helped me a lot and I recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their punctuation and review their English grammar knowledge.",4
6414,"Great course; very informative, highly educational, fascinating... There were just two things I didn't like about the professor, though I liked HER a lot; she was very welcoming, hospitable, and amicable; she treated her students well, and was enthusiastic about teaching us. That is a trait I have seen for the first time on Coursera, and I have to give Dr. Chagpar high praise in these terms. The only things I did not like - which are very small in contrast to the things I did like - were that she taught a bit as though she was teaching to 6th graders, rather than seasoned adults. But that is not much of an issue. My only other complaint is that she seemed quite callous towards women suffering - even dying - from breast cancer. But I suppose breast surgeons come to distance themselves from these terrible, tragic events.",4
12873,Course is very interesting but i think the videos are very short. Better to make longer videos,4
17161,"Great overview of the subject, appropriate homework assignments to understand de value of the concepts we ar talking about",4
90712,"It is a great course for me. At the end of the course, I learned how to generate a trajectory having several set waypoints and have my drone follow the trajectory autonomously in simulation.As opposed to the stated prerequisite, I believe the course requires engineering/math/physics background.On the down side, there is no TA presence in the discussion forum. You will need to rely on your classmates if you are stuck. Also the second assignment requires hours of tuning, which serves almost no educational purpose.",4
4225,"Very useful knowledge in this course. Although, some of the quizzes require some small fixes, and there are minor mistakes in some lectures.",4
4192,"This course have good teachers and material. The articles of peers which you should read and assess are very Interesting, deep and curious.",4
33676,Excellent Course and Instructor! I would highly recommend this course to any new student interested in learning more about HTML and web development. The course is designed to provide the student with an introductory knowledge of HTML coding and introduces concepts in a very easy to understand manner.,4
101025,I rate it 4.5 stars,4
36405,"Excellent course. Robert Shiller is a very accessible and personable lecturer, making you really feel like you are in the lecture theatre.The course material is relevant and delivered in an interesting way. The assessment questions perhaps don't challenge the learners understanding as much as it could.... however never the less a great introduction to Financial Markets and recommended for anyone wanting to dip their toe in to this area or enhance existing knowledge.Many thanks Yale Uni, Prof Shiller and Coursera.",4
7684,Thank you.,4
38888,Great course!,4
28235,Assignments could be more fun and hard but the course was very good.,4
57024,Overall it's a pretty great course. I just didn't find the homework that enlightening though - but I suppose that may just be a consequence of the issues involved in formatting a MOOC.,4
81880,"It shows the basics of each subject. A good start to learn the technologies HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.",4
52320,Though my educational background is not economics but I have taken this course out of my interest about Korea and made the right choice. I have enjoyed the course very much and learned a lot.,4
92678,This course is really awesome.Opens up totally different thought process and introduces to some European firms which are really good.,4
45679,"This course is a lite and approachable collection of tips on how to work with your brain to learn more effectively. It won't blow your mind with advanced techniques you haven't heard before, but it is a nice succinct overview of what works better and what doesn't work so well. I picked up a few tips and had to sheepishly admit that I was guilty in the past of studying in a less than ideal way (I have a Bachelors degree). I would say this is a particularly useful course for young adults to take as it's not too heavy and is useful in explaining to them how to be more effective and why the techniques in the course work. That is not to say of course, that it is not useful for all ages.I found Barbara to be reasonably effective as a presenter. She speaks a little slowly for my taste, but I sped up the playback speed to 1.25 and that made it comfortable. Her lectures are well thought out and smoothly delivered.I found Terry Sejnowski contributed little to the course however. His explanations were fumbling, muddled and confusing. I found myself reading Wikipedia more often then not to get a better explanation on the concepts he was supposed to be teaching. He just didn't explain them well. He also didn't really explain why he was explaining them at all. The lecture on neurotransmitters was particularly bad. In what way did any of that help me learn how to learn? I think most of his lectures are just not that necessary to the course. I also think Barbara could have done a better job herself. But I understand her wanted to include him as he is an apparent authority in the area and it lends some credibility to her course.I think it's well worth taking and again I think this would be ideal for school kids (secondary) to help instill good practices early and steer them around a couple of easy to make mistakes.",4
106959,It was good tips. it has really interesting interviews. It was been really positive experience and encouraging to keep writing.,4
32442,Some of the lectures were a little dull but the information was fantastic!,4
28012,"A very good introduction to this specialization, with fun and thought-provoking exercisees.",4
68101,Very good introduction to machine learning with good examples.Some questions in the quiz could be rephrased to avoid multiple possible interpretations.,4
101393,videos are very informativeEnglish is very simple and easy to understand,4
11570,"This course was a great overview introduction into ASD. The information was presented so the information was not overwhelming. You begin the course by looking at ASD from a wide-lens down to details. This is recommended for anyone who is interested in learning more about ASD and then to take more details classes as needed. The videos that were part of the course were informative. There was not a lot of discussions nor was this class led by any instructor. I wished it had links to more articles or more in-depth information, especially the weeks on the developmental areas.",4
19998,"Good material. The notes or transcripts were rather poorly done, making for a lot of editing to get the supplied text to a usable form. More interviews with outside experts would have been welcome. Case studies were informative and useful.",4
46136,"Excellent course in understanding how our brain works in learning. It really provides some great knowledge that, if applied, can change your life to the better and improve your chances in success!",4
42023,Great info and advice.,4
25732,I really enjoyed this course!,4
100085,"It's a wonderful course. Trust me you will not stay the same, unless you don't want to!",4
93057,"Amazing Tutorial and course. The methods they use are simple but the lack of exercises in programming, its a downside. In my programming experience, it's needed more practical examples. Swirl is one side of the course that helps the user understand what R programming is, but in my opinion, different examples or projects are needed.",4
9129,"I believe that the teacher creates a great way of explaining what seems to be very complicated thought processes, and he does so in a highly enthusiastic manner.The only downside is that such explanations can be either too low level or not strong enough to explain certain phenomena. For example, the professor talks about how the absolute value function of x is not differentiable at zero, and how a function is differentiable at a certain point when the two-sided limit exists and, by extension, the function is continuous at that same given point. However, the professor in this regard never truly explains why the v-shape is not differentiable and how it relates to our definition of continuity. However, overall: a very worthwhile course and a pleasant experience.",4
52128,"Good course, very well structured and understable materials",4
69015,"This course is a pretty cool intro to the GraphLab Create library. However, I would have preferred something more challenging, even for a survey course.Though the discussion forums were generally very active (I posted at least one question that was answered by a TA very promptly), there was a question I had towards the end of the course that never got answered. I wasn't alone in this... many people were having a very similar problem.In general, I think the course was good. But, if you have even a very shallow familiarity with Machine Learning and/or Python, you may be able to skip this one and move straight into the Regression course.",4
74393,A good introductory course to Python.Intended for real beginners,4
91770,It's better to use Python 3 version.,4
20091,"Good introduction, excellent instructor.",4
50574,"I enjoyed everything about this course. The lectures were snappy, engaging and informative. The topics moved quickly, but not so much that it skimmed.The resources don't always work (because the links are external) and the exams are misaligned, with questions on the Week 6 exam based on lectures from Week 7. This is a problem, and will reduce people's grades for sure, but this doesn't sway me from recommending this course.",4
91248,I loved this course ... very easy to understand i discovered new things i didn't know! Thank u.,4
49805,This course gives a broad overview of what the Internet of Things is and the components that comprise IoT devices.,4
44690,Good tips that can help when learning new things/subjects/skills.,4
105978,4.5 stars actually. Good overview of modeling risk.,4
3909,Introduces the basics of Arduino and C programming. Not a lot of content but gets you ready for the next course in the 4-course Specialisation.,4
5011,A very good review of the main topics related to the Arctic and climate change. Final lesson tests are sometimes confusing.,4
28156,I enjoyed the course as a,4
105189,"I feel that the course was great but I felt confused on the last assignment, we covered a lot of things during the last week but then I was unsure if I should've applied that on our assignment... Also I'm not sure if it is possible but if we could have a chance to ask the teacher questions would be great. I know that there is a lot of people going this courses and maybe it is not possible but still there are things that I feel only the teacher could answer. Overall the course was good :)",4
48490,its practical and understandable,4
5252,Course is really well made foe beginners in statistics. This is relevant.,4
5826,"Explanation could have been more clear, especially for polynomial multiplication.",4
100927,An overall excellent course. 4-stars are attributed purely because of the limitations of when a quiz can be re-sat (twice in 7 days). This elongated the duration of the course.The material learnt within the course has been immediately applicable in my job - with success.,4
51091,"Interesting and informative. The only reason it is not 5-stars is because some lectures were too much PR, and some assignments required non-scientists to name-drop microbes and design a study without proper reference.",4
19388,"Good course. Challenging, detailed and academic. Suitable for people with basic grasp of human biology, in particular metabolic functions, as well as research methods.",4
25898,Great course - You're learning the foundations of building games with the most ubiquitous game engine - Unity!,4
32837,"I really like the way that Colleen presented the materials. A lot of histories and related information. Since I have some experience in coding, I can follow along. But I think the course will be difficult for fresh starters.",4
97363,"Good overview of evolution. I appreciated the videos discussing how to best teach evolution in the classroom. The instructors assume you have some science knowledge, so if you do not, you may find some vocabulary and topics are not explained as well as they should be.",4
44664,Very usefull. A transversal skill that we all need,4
53152,"hope that i can finish this short course and hope that it is more asy to send an assignment here ,,, i love this expirience it was very fantastic hope that i can be more active soon , thanks and god bless",4
9464,I have just started but it looking real interesting so far.,4
76824,"Easy to follow. The videos tie back to the book, this gives you the option of digesting the information on multiple ways.Pace could be a bit faster, but this program is flexible so you can complete it earlier if you want to.",4
47964,This course is amazing. I am a french student and it helps me a lot in and outside my studies.,4
10036,The lectures provided by the Professor were very much insightful and helpful. Especially the interview videos of the C level executives were great. Had lot of information and the exams were fun to answer.,4
50836,"Great Course, looking forward to the rest of the specialization",4
61275,"Hope to have more reference to research, all in all great course Thank you a lot!",4
93176,Good to learn fundamentals of R,4
94526,This was a tough class covering a lot of material. The last week on logistic regression completely lost me. If you're new to stats like me you might want to take it more than once.,4
89839,Nice Basic course with enough explanations. The video quality was not good and text in video was barely visible.,4
9493,"The classes are very didactic, however the professor sometimes meanders too much and doesn't get to the point. Also, some of the the quizzes have little or nothing to do with the video lessons.",4
22373,Easy to undersstand,4
69176,Although a few concepts are a bit wishy washy this is a high quality course on leadership.,4
1590,Good course however the test have difficult questions since are open to different points of views or judgements so it is hard to get the right answer.,4
39019,Good for complete beginners.,4
87330,The course is great and it definitely left me wanting more content.,4
94231,briefly summarised the machine learning algorithms. Good place to start!,4
79829,Very informative and helpful to learn the foundation of the PMBOK knowledge areas.,4
41114,Good course with good concepts but could do with a lot more depth. This course's content would be one week of content for other courses,4
67324,Great introductory content into the subject. Monitoring/moderation of the forums could be improved.,4
15127,Decent starting course for beginners.,4
92798,Good lessons and very good assignments,4
51178,Great course for those with little knowledge of international marketing.,4
87451,"Dr. Chuck is so skilled at teaching. His teaching style and presentations are easy to follow. The class is not as challenging as other Python courses, but it's a great step to learning Python well.",4
51995,"It seems staff do not monitor, or address, issues posted repeatedly to the forum, especially in regards to the final test (part 2 of the specialty). The content of the course is great, and if someone with the authority to make changes when errors are detected and reported did care for the course I would have have rated the course higher.",4
30456,"Good course, easy to understand, and useful.",4
64310,The questions are hard to understand and ambiguous though their answers are easy.,4
21293,"My congratulations to all those people who worked to create this course although I have to pick up something I've found a bit annoying:1- there were two video where the audio were nearly unintelligible2- I would link the link proposed by the video to be possible to be clicked3- Some exposition imperfection (even if they make these video more ""real and human"")4- Since quiz are not so difficult to be evaluated automatically I found it a bit annoying to notice them locked by not-purchsing, even if I understand there have to be something which would make the customer to purchase.I've found the swirl experience great although a bit annoying sometimes but I've no clue on how to possibly improve it so.Keep up with this great work!Bye",4
101895,"A little light on content, but has valuable resources for my wife's home business.",4
2530,it was an awesome course. One of the best I attended from Coursera.,4
52669,Great course. Learning Java Data Structures and Cipher encryption was fun.Good material and problems,4
93737,"The course takes more time and is more informative than the Toolbox course. The material in the videos is quite more basic than the material in the quizzes and assignments, but that should be expected. The only improvement I would suggest is to give lecture material on the deeper concepts involved in the assignments.",4
63182,"Very good course leading to insightful consideration for new managers. Quickly applicable with the Thought Model exercise. Would highly recommend. I give it 4 starts out of 5 because some improvement needed around expected deadlines on week 3, and for a few technical bugs: one must be logged into a browser to participate in the discussion forum - I couldn't make it work from my iPad or iPhone apps.",4
25326,Very good course. Should be followed by Game Theory II,4
54782,A complete end to end application of machine learning would make us more confident after completing the course.,4

12992,Good amount of knowledge,4
81633,"I feel that the same monotone group of people, talking in a drab setting, was so monotonous it was difficult to keep focused on the lesson at hand. I know education is not supposed to be all zip, pow, bang, woah, and such, and I am not suggesting that it should be, but a little break from the drone tempo would be a nice addition. Other than that the course was on par and enjoyable. I liked the self meditative assignments most.",4
17658,Good intro to data science and has given overall information what a data scientist actually do in a high level.,4
11890,"I enjoyed the course. My background is mathematics, but not specifically statistics, though I do have a basic understanding of elementary frequentist statistics. My goal was to understand the fundamentals and uses of Bayesian statistics, having attempted that via a couple of textbooks without much success; this time, I got it!I do have some reservations about the course. Herbie Lee spent a huge amount of time deriving formulas and methods - a few gaps (either hand waving or 'leave it to the student to finish') would have been helpful, I think. This would leave more time for examples and applications. But the course was well worth my time and effort.",4
77012,"Course is great, but the platforms has some bugs, which is very annoying when you are completing tasks.",4
24269,In general terms the course is very good. It would be great if they could include at least one real example of each statistic method presented.,4
48141,"Fantastic course, well explained and documented.",4
93980,This was a tough course and I actually moved to another schedule. I think a sixth week on using excel to solve problems would have been worthwhile.,4
21569,"Informative, numerous examples, great for beginners. Locked content is the downside.",4
19066,Very well explained for both biologists and computer scientists.,4
99562,"As a woman, I learned a surprising amount of stuff I never knew before",4
90964,I enjoyed this class and learned a lot. The intervening research topics did not seem to be part of the grading for this course and I am not sure if anyone did them after the first one. The final peer assessment project just asked for a repeat of everything that had been said in the class since the final lecture went all the way up to Obamacare. There was no room to add anything to what the course had already said.,4
74966,"Some of the lectures were a bit too informal to my taste, but still got the messages across",4
30165,this course is very interesting and good.,4
65354,a great way to start.,4
11983,"I learned a lot of useful information in this course--my first on Coursera--and I'm really excited to see how I will apply the things I learned here in real projects. Although I think that it would be beneficial if the course also required us to submit our code (not just watch and read) and also explain github at least a little, I feel that I am well-primed now to acquire more knowledge of how to make apps in the future. I positively adored the instructor (his accent and way of explanation made it so fun). Thanks, Clement!",4
20094,"Good overview of engineering statics. However, I wish the homework and/or practice problems were built into the coursera platform like the quizzes.",4
80781,Very useful framework introduction!,4
99667,"Great introductory course for the subject. There were some parts, especially at the start of this course, in which the subject matters were being explained too simplistically and very quickly - not a good combination to maximize ones efforts.",4
45898,"Just Great! Only bad point; to too extensive, examples and concepts were briefly described and left out areas which I thought was interesting. But on the whole, just great - I recommend everyone to take this course!",4

36750,"This course so far is really very useful in my academics and through this course, I am now well-versed with all the marketing strategies used in the industry.I would like to thank the professor for teaching us so well.",4
30510,it's very useful for its purpose,4
96630,"Great intro course that fully dives into Bootstrap and all it's capabilities. The site that you build in this course can actually be a decent addition to any portfolio for a new web designer too.I would have given it a 5/5, but I thought the course moved too slowly and rushed over explaining the available JavaScript and jQuery plugins that Bootstrap has to offer. The plugins are quite useful not just within Bootstrap, and they can be installed and customized for a range of web projects.Expect to dedicate at least 3-4 hours a week just completing the module lectures and exercises along with the homework assignment. This is not out of the ordinary though, Bootstrap does have a lot of components to cover. I truly believe Professor Muppala is the best person to do it as well. I appreciated his input in the discussion forums and thorough instruction.",4

It gives the basics of the language, syntax, what happens when we interact with a computer etc. The instructor was well prepared not only in terms of content but also it is obvious he cares about things like teaching at scale. I also liked he gave credit to everyone who helped him to prepare for the course. I suggest this to anyone who wants to learn python, based on ones experience and dedication, completing all the content can take down to 1-2 days.",4
13948,Very introductory - can finish the class well before the 4 weeks are over.,4
41036,"This course provides a nice insight into the gaming theory. Do not expect to make a dive into video game analysis. This game focuses on the fundamental ideas behind gaming, which includes all games. However, the assignments revolve around building board games, so you do not need to worry about not knowing any coding to make video games. Assignment criteria could use some polish, as the rubrics focus too much on mechanics (is it one page long?) rather than content elements. The delivery of the content is interesting. The instructor has gone to great lengths to bring in features that will help you focus better. There could be a better 100% integration between the material in the videos and the assignments, as sometimes you are asked to use only a tiny portion of 30 minutes of videos for the week, and that can make the videos less useful, or the assignment not as educational.",4
89877,A very good course for starting with python. If you already know something about programming this is perfect for starting knowing how wonderful is python.,4
11571,I'd like to learn a bit more about ASD.,4
16237,"i personaly feel its too general, on the surface. i would rther know more on fewer sociologist.",4
57456,"A good introduction to machine learning. Andrew Ng has a more in-depth course on Stanford Engineering Everywhere, if anyone wants to learn more.",4
33490,"Five stars for emphasis on accessibility, explanation and detail of semantic elements.Three stars for course content testing prior to publication and for omission of Linux. I use sftp on a command-line interface and did not learn in this course how to use mput for putting multiple HTML files and web assets onto my live site. There is no hyphen in ""meta-data"", nor are there two hyphens in ""local area network.",4
85542,"Excellent course! Extremely well organized and definitely provides a lot of great information. The quiz questions are too easy, which is why it's not 5 stars.",4
49435,Interesting one....,4
36,I think it should be a more engaged course with practical examples,4
42328,"It is conceptual compared to other courses, however it brings a lot in increasing our self-awareness. Very much appreciated.",4
28124,"The materials and knowledge of the fundamentals from this course are helpful. However, the assignments and peer grading threw me off. I did not like the fact that your grade depended on students' review of your assignments. It is all subjective. Good course materials, poor grading system.",4
91808,Really good course. Clear discussion of databases and how they are used.,4
37624,Learnt alot but it needs more examples to help with the projects -note i am a total beginner and i think the time needed to study for me is 3x that was is stated.,4
1227,"Lectures were very clear and assignments were really helpful for me to understand gist of each algorithms. This course, however, only covers 1. Basic concepts of Graph, 2. Shortest Path, and 3. Minimum Spanning Tree which doesn’t seem to be rich.With more diverse and interesting problems associated with Graph included, I strongly believe that students will get much from this course.Thank you",4
94096,Great. Easy to understand and very practical.,4
106781,"This course is great so far - really helpful and specific - but I feel like there is an unnecessary amount of repetition of certain points. We were told ""use your own experiences to fuel your stories"" in 2 videos with David Hill, a reading assignment and then again in a video talking to another author. While I appreciate the ""look, they say it too!"" idea of backing up their ideas, I feel like this is overkill.",4
71119,pure functional approach to solve problems.,4
26680,Could've been more thorough. Basics still well taught.,4
104872,Good course. Very interesting.pace is very high,4
24613,Engaging intro course with superb visuals and virtual specimens.,4
106881,I learned some helpful tips on how to edit and how to better structure a story. But there were assignments particularly on the last two that should have used assignment two or three.,4
31418,Very interesting and useful course.Thanks a lot !,4
78879,Thorough course with a decent starters' course for people who are new to R.,4
70455,"This is a solid course. The videos are a bit low quality, and the API's used are sorta derpy, but the content is good.",4
82666,exposure to libraries and advanced features of scala,4
98785,one the best backend development courses on the web . covers a lot of topics . and yet gives you enough depth to be able to discover the rest on your own. the only problem with it is that it stall on the some basic stuff and then accelerates (a little) when it comes to the more advanced techniques.,4
2954,"This course will supplement your class, but do not use it as a single source.",4
83817,It is an excellent course but it would be nice if he talk about complexity of these data structures. Over all this course is nice for complete beginner in the word of programming,4
98518,"good; but not as good as the other modules in the specialisation; the instructions for the assignments are a bit too convoluted, clarity would be added not by adding more information, but by reducing the text.",4
50915,Very well structured course. Course content was simple to understand and rich enough to cover important aspects of the discipline. Well articulated and well delivered by the teachers. Would like to deep dive into other related topics and specifically looking forward to Scrum tools and techniques in detail.,4
105093,"There wasn't a list of suggested Reading, but It is really motivating to make the difference in bus",4
60667,one thing is that people eat horses today in iceland too but super helpfull,4
92215,Very good introduction to databases and the use of this with python. uses python 2 version. Simple explanation for beginners. Recommended.,4
82011,very nice fundamentals. I like the way they begin with the most basic elements. Then add on additional incremental elements to make the projects more sophisticated and our knowledgebase more sophisticated.,4
100313,I hope Mrs. Margaret tutorial will help me in managing my work future.,4
62869,"Some parts are needed more clarification. In other words, as a student of the course you need to go beyond the materials, since the materials are not self-sufficient. Specially about simulation methods. However, this is not the reason that I give the course 4 out of 5. The absence of any help from TAs, based on my experience, is the reason. I expected some official replies to my question while there are only a few question for each week of the course.",4
84610,"Good course, fun to learn. If you know programming and just want to know how to use python, you can complete this course in a day.",4
13681,An excellent class. It helped me sharpen up my writing. I would say this is better than any book I ever read on writing. A huge part of it was in the reading and reviewing of other student's work. I felt I learned even more in doing that.,4
48927,"The Broad Fundamental Basics that everyone should know. The course was effective in convening the must know-hows and how to adequately implement them. I was expecting the course to be slightly more challenging, however I already have legal know how, so apart from that, its a worth while investment in ones life that can be applied in and for any organisation.",4
68238,I love what I am learning in this course however some of the lectures are completely disconnected from the quizzes. They could do a better job quizzing based on the lecture.,4
93894,"What's best in this course: the assignments. Requiring a short few paragraph essay answers to a few questions at the end of each week is so much better than just relying on multiple choice questionnaires. This encourages participants to do a little bit more, at least glimpse through a few relevant Wikipedia articles.Of course there is plenty of multiple choice questionnaires and videos as well. Some of the videos are a bit dated, but that makes them even more interesting as an archaeological evidence. Besides, the subject matter isn't moving forward very fast, though new research reveals new things at a slow yet constant pace.",4
2524,Loved the Tableau section and the instructor is a good communicator. It'd be great to have a whole course about this BI Software,4
81901,There were times I got lost on the explanations.However it is a great manner to begin,4
60291,It can be more interactive if small exercises are followed by each video as in edx.,4
49800,Was a good introduction to IoT,4
36298,"This was overall a really interesting course. Robert Shiller is really good at storytelling and giving out intuitions about complex financial problems. The (prestigious) guest speakers also enhanced tremendously the appeal of the mooc. Carl Icahn's interview on its own is worth enrolling for this course. The only drawback I found was that this is a typical ""research university course"" in the sense that most of the material should be tackled outside of the classroom, through Fabozzi's textbook in this case. However nothing stops you from reading it of course...",4
35524,Peer-Grading assignment is not completely fair. Depending on them is not logical since not all of them are fully educated in this course that's the reason we're taking the course in the first place. but over all it is good and the proff is amazing.,4
20877,It was a very useful course with a lot of practical examples.,4
105999,This is very meaningful.,4
85896,Useful course for applying,4
102118,More insight about SEO tactics and SEO history. The breakdown of topic into sessions were well-defined and easy-understanble for amateur like me !,4
48281,very nice course but the quizzes are difficult,4
56330,Programming exercises are really hard and you don't find much help,4
2895,Thanks everyone for such an interesting experience.,4
12635,The course is really interesting and it is very clear.thanks a lot of !Sylvain,4
4556,It will be better adding examples related with engineering cases (this is for technical people in any branch of engineering).,4
69111,Useful course to get general idea to get onboard with Machine Learning.,4
100788,Great introduction to a very promising technology!,4
30573,"I like this course. It was a little hard at first, but then I got the hang of it!",4
82753,"Good course.Next step to get specialization in Scala and FP.Many thanks, Pavel",4
81189,"very interesting courses, but there is written material that you can go when you want to refresh concepts.",4
100495,A very fruitful effort and a nice MOOC by Univ of London allowing many many people/researchers across the globe to learn about state of art research methods which are usually not taught at MPhil or PhD levels.,4
92557,It looks a good course from its contents.,4
29459,It would be better to provide detailed explanation for the cases and questions raised in the slides.,4
105646,"Very good, but after all the hard work one should be able to pursue a paid certificate at least",4
48320,Great tools for effective learning.,4
75140,"professor chuck is very humorous and basically, this course is extremely good for those who haven't learn any programming languages. It is sometimes seen to me that it is a little bit easy. However, the overall is quite perfect!! I love it !",4
13191,Very structured which allows a step-by-step,4
28394,Very good to understand the basics of graphic design,4
88110,"I really enjoyed the mathematical point and percentage explanation and the tools to grade assignments enlightening . I always have struggled with the math of grading. I felt that the first and second weeks were very repetitive information; therefore I didn't give it a five star. Otherwise, I thought it was good information. Thanks",4
62155,I enjoyed the course a lot and will encourage executives (marketing or not) to consider opening their perspective about marketing and the digital works. I will ask that some practice examples be updated to revalidate the strength of some new concepts (digital marketing is STILL considered relatively new domain to MANY). It will also make the course close to participants with fresher examples.,4
23738,"Really interesting! Now a days I act suspicious about the food I'm buying. It's a journey to integrate this information to a healthy lifestyle, the workshop is great help for that.",4
89555,"I enrolled the course expecting a little more vision on ""how to read"" a photograph, a composition, although thanks to the Curator I now understood that the context (time, environment, history, …) is important to that purpose.I appreciated the competence with which she treated each subject and the interesting perspective given to the various modules. It gave me a new viewpoint in what photography really is.Good videos and interviews made it easier to understand.Some readings from the required and additional resources were difficult because of the concepts.I personally found some topics (module 5 and 6) a bit abstract and difficult to follow, but I put myself into it to expand my knowledge and open my mind.",4
40441,Amazing. The only suggestion i can make is about treatment. To be more practical.,4
65416,Great introductory overview. I particularly enjoyed the summary of the human genome project.,4
33551,"Lectures are great. Colleen sounds very amiable. She has great tips.Downside: You're only required to do some coding for the final project. I think this course would be better if they'll add an in-browser editor so students could play with code after a lecture.Yes, I do play with code after the lecture to get around it, but I think the way the lectures are presented tempt the students not to. So any additional prompts such as in-browser editor - for in-lecture quizzes - definitely will help.",4
89636,"The course is a good introduction on how to look at images from a different perspective. Good materials, highly enjoyable. The reading lists are pretty good, with interesting additional material.",4
54541,Andrew Ng is Very humble. The course content was made very lucid and easier than it could have been.,4
27759,"I loved the course, it really help me a lot to understand Graphic Design and to find inspiration in the things that surround us, which mostly are composed of basic geometric shapes.",4
35745,Very difficult !!,4
90217,"Pros: Excellent material, great that slides are available for downloadCons: The videos are much too long and have too much detail that could just be added as footnotes in the slides.",4
7772,The course was very informative. I enjoyed doing this course.,4
42071,An absolutely amazing experience and a good learning. Karl Gude has been a good facilitator and a very good expert in sharing his experience may it be practical or knowledge sharing.,4
23087,This course was informative with great tips for healthy eating.,4
12681,"This was a good introductory class to machine learning, but I wish it had more depth.",4
94125,very helpful but i finished it and there are no results to see!,4
79438,Very nice starting point for personal branding. Encourages self-reflection and awareness via a few exercises. Touches upon social media presence and use.Very helpfull in building your personal brand.,4
64153,I have learned a lot.,4
102362,"A nice course to take on a hard subject of Mind, Moral Truth. Found it enlightening thanks all the team for bringing such a course out to the world.",4
93697,"The content was great, especially the swirl() library. The instructions were a little confusing at times, but the online advisors helped to sort it out.",4
63068,great course. I enjoy many point about RTOS from here. Thanks ^^,4
98368,"Interesting, insightful, well explained, practical.",4
101362,The course is overall great. Maybe a little simple for a STAT major. Thank you!,4
29892,"Very good, broad introduction to many of the issues surrounding this epidemic. My only criticism (and why I only gave it 4 stars) was the unbridled self-congratulatory tone and Emory-centeredness of the course. I realize this is probably a function of why Universities create these free courses. There is a marketing aspect to it. But it did get a little tedious.",4
71339,"the only problem here is the assigments, they are hard and unrelated somehow to the videos",4
105942,Useful for business risk analysis and modeling complex problem.,4
56118,Great overview of most promizing ML techniques. Just enough math to be able to use the knowledge but not too much to make the course heavy. Stimulating. Oriented to people that want to be operative on ML rahter than understand,4
25638,great information from diverse teachers.,4
90363,"Good material, but even better external material shown by links to blogs or related stuff.Too focused in SCRUM. Maybe other methodologies are worth to explain.I'll not buy it since I'm a SM, but if you are beginning with this topics or want to pursue a SM certificate, this course definitively can help you.",4
20424,Very informative! Professor Hornstein makes the topics easy to understand & interesting despite little knowledge on environmental law.,4
35701,I just fell in love with the course from the first experience I had. Hoping to eventually rate it has 5 star,4
26013,"The only thing that stands between the 5 and 4 stars evaluation of this course is the fact that assignments should have a broader range of grades for the peer review (like 0-2.5-5-7.5-10).On all the rest, congratulations! It is a great course!",4
90918,Quizzes are generally not related to topic but course is great. Thanks..,4
71739,"Thanks to team that put together the course, I really liked itIt covers the topics in sufficient detail with relevant cases /examples, which makes its really easy to get the concept.Would be nice to also have (which is why I did not give it a 5 on 5) - A section on team structure (which in my view is the missing link for this course and which often is a challenge managers cope with and can have a big influence on motivation) and a few more corporate speakers / examples (beyond Menlo, people not from US don't really know much about this company)Overall a course I would surely recommend to all people in my team",4
105017,Valuable experience. Well composed. Not designed for Sales and Product Managers though.,4
49473,"The introductory session is really great ,but it can be explained little more deep technically !!!",4
75103,Quite self sufficient. Easy to follow. Pace is fine but a little bit slow for someone with programming experience in other language.,4
5441,Moves too fast,4
64464,Good introductory course. No labs involved. No certificate issued.,4
24928,"Not enough teaching from the professors , just presentation slides. Which kind of reduced the human component of learning.",4
75376,Very nice but must have included more videos and explained the course in depth.,4
12749,A well done course. Some on-line exercises are necessary.,4
80601,Excellent course for anyone interested in improving their negotiation skills. Ever since the first lesson I have started looking at the business world from a new perspective. The book is a great read and not too exhaustive.,4
36161,Interesting first-introduction to financial markets,4
93089,"Somewhat hard, but rewarding.",4
91355,"As an advanced English speaker, for me this course goes too little into improvement of pronounciation.The tips for conversations - small talk, phone, online etc. - are only very basic as well.Good course for beginners though and I also liked the interspersal of little questions and tasks along the way (although also too simple imo).Very good - but obviously only paid content - are the teamwork assignments.",4
80442,Very interesting and enriching course. It gave me more than what I expected. Definitely a must for young negotiators,4
23286,A great course to establish a fundamental understanding of positive nutrition as well as integral steps that can be taken and implemented everyday to start a meanginfu,4
99946,"I liked the course, however I'd like to give some feedback that might be useful to you:I was surprised a bit how short the course is. When I read this ""4-8 hours of videos, readings, and quizzes"" I thought that there will be 4-8 hours of videos _besides_ readings and quizzes. So this one is a bit misleading.Despite of this I liked the course. It gave me a lot of tricks and tips. However I don't understand the final 96.4% either. Maybe I missed something because after the last assignment the result has gone away in less then 1 second. As far as I know all my assignments were 100%.The design of the videos is a bit ""spartan"" :) I finished a couple of other Coursera courses (HCI, Gamification etc.) where the videos were much more delightful. This white background, black text is very disappointing.Anyway: Thanks!",4
24296,"Good discussion video, faculties of UCL were excellent. should have more contents and further reading materials. Felt the course is more UK centric, also bit more insight to education referring to the old educationists should be added advantage! Thank you for this nice course. Need more such courses for teachers and",4
8771,It was very good!,4
89917,This was great. I had to do some more reading into the videos and spend more time trying to produce output in different formats to learn more.I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture.I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week.This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on.Thumbs up Prof. Boyd and crew!!,4
3272,"Easy to understand, but hard to listen. I think we need a American teacher",4
80284,Lessons are not compatible with tablets.,4
26133,"Would have hoped for a bit more coding without hand holding, but I did learn Unity basics well!",4
69306,Very well explained. I think it will be much better if there is a revision of previous weeks teaching in current week.,4
23624,Good introduction course,4
88119,"Good course to know the basics of IoT and AR, the references are very helpful to deep in the topics.",4
12640,"I found this very interesting, covering some topics I did not expect an introduction. I think the pace of the course is about right, but I would have liked more questions. Unfortunately I became very busy during the course and failed to keep up. I look forward to repeating it when I have more time.",4
51409,Good course,4
36595,"Could've been more complicated and in-depth, but I suppose for a Coursera lesson it was fine. Kinda felt like a Yale advertisement, more than a finance course. Prof. Schiller was very good, I do enjoy listening to his lectures, interviews and any other material i can get my hands on.",4
8100,"Informative without being preachy. Cute, entertaining drawings.",4
102316,"I liked the course contents, especially the Google algorithm evolution and the assignment to do an SEO analysis.I felt the first week content related to the jobs in the field of SEO was a bit long and could have been shortened since many aspects were repeated in the ""consulting/agency"" and ""in-house"" roles.",4
41318,It is the best course for the beginners who want to learn java differently.,4
40114,Very useful and well explained.,4
93453,Very useful！,4
44762,very interesting and informative course.,4
12283,I enjoyed the structure of the modules and the recommended readings were very,4
12977,"Good information, would have preferred more in-depth lectures and detailed information. More lecturer interaction/engagement on the issues.Overall I enjoyed the course and it was great.",4
72284,"interesting, the photos, the film and voice records really bring us back to the time in the past, which also help me know what the real south is.",4
1941,Good course for beginners. the final assignment should have been with a detailed data set.,4
2463,Good Course for Introductory Tableau Visualization.,4
16592,It is a really great course! I learnt a lot!,4
46612,"Content:A couple of simple tips and tricks that can definitely help people to learn better and faster.I personally discovered the ""Mind palace"" technique which I trust can help me a lot, so thanks !Form:Lectures well prepared, and the combination of ideas/slides is rather well made.Sometimes some videos could be shortened as the concepts are not really hard to follow. Some more practical examples could be used in the material.Thanks for this teaching material :-)",4
25948,"The course was really enjoyable, I learned a great deal about game development and Unity 3D in general. I loved the practical approach and getting to know the ins and outs of Unity a lot better. The very last project was the only part I didn't learn as much from. Where going through the code wasn't really helpful - as it's so complicated to someone like me who is very new to C# and coding in general, but I understand it would take too much time to go in depth and that isn't really what the course is about.Otherwise I had a fantastic experience and would definitely like to continue my learning with more courses similar to this! Thanks!",4
30036,"Overall, the course is fine, however there were several annoying typos / rounding issues, which would prevent you from getting the correct answer.",4
25055,I liked the talks a lot but didnt expect to be forced to draw :),4
67863,A very good basic course. Tough homeworks. Be prepared to put in some effort to crack this course. But it's worth the time you spend on it.,4
98892,A good introductory course spanning full-stack server side development. I liked the structured flow of lessons and excercises.A great minus though is that this course has little to none focus on testing. While in the middle of this course I lack insight into testing strategies with node js.,4
71307,"Nice course, hometasks are about medium level difficulty (in hackerrank terms). Problems are already half-completed, so you're just filling the gaps following the design. That really shows the power of scala in things like pattern matching (suddenly, it's everywhere!) and functional programming approach (lots of small functions with pretty narrow scopes). So althouth you can program just as if it was java, you're kinda pushed to do scala.Thanks for the course.",4
19300,"Nice course, good intro. Pretty thin but helpful and good value for money.",4
34396,"The course is a great intro to excel, but there are some errors in a few of the data examples (good practice data cleansing!)",4
34793,Good teaching methods. Convenient for starting to get to know GIS software and sharing your map data.,4
26196,"I really liked this course. Although some of it depended too much on pre-made scripts it was at the level of games that make sense to a beginner without being to complex (like all of Unity's own tutorials are). Sometimes, it went to fast and I was quickly switching from Unity to Coursera to hit the ""pause"" button to give me time to catch up. I thought that it took way to long to download other participants work in order to evaluate it, but I think that is an issue with Coursera and not with this course.",4
69767,"This course includes major topics of daily life. After having completed all lessons with Professor Xiaoyu Liu, the student will be able to express himself/herself in many useful situations. This fast result of some basic Chinese is very motiviating to complete the course and to continue studying this fascinating language. The only drawback may be the lack of some corresponding Chinese characters. However, this may exceed the scope of this Coursera course. Maybe there will be a course Chinese for Beginners 2 in future. If so, I would certainly participate.",4
68881,Good course with the overview of different machine learning techniques,4
101914,Good introductory course to social media.,4
23187,"This Course is useful and practical for all the students and people would like to know the detail of food and health. Actually, after finishing this course, I have a stronger interest in food than before. If the lecturer can give us more information about this area, that would be better.",4
338,"The problems are really challenging, thank you! However, the instructor is not very active in the discussion forum, which is a pity when you really need help and get stucked in the problem set.",4
28424,A very detailed course with good analysis frameworks.,4
11701,It was a great course although it was not exactly what I expected.,4
66268,"Fantastic course! Audio needs some re-mastering, was frustrating at times.",4
95711,"I enjoyed the structure of the lectures. For me the composers stories, the analysis of the narratives and the musical fragments were extremely interesting. Without an extensive background on music theory however, I had some difficulties following the musical analysis of Mia sometimes. However, I learned a lot, and am really grateful for your effort to put together a course in which you presented so many great composers in an attractive fashion to a large public, without losing the grandeur of the music.",4
81198,Answers are always the first option. I don't like that.,4
3433,"I think it's a very good introduction to AngularJS. You learn and understand what you're doing in almost lessons. I'd hardly recommend it to any beginner !!!I found that the 4rth week was very very compressed. You could spend 1 more week explaining all the Front-End tools such as Gulp, Grunt, Yo (Yeoman) etc. And go deeper with the AngularJS as well.In some points I felt myself alone with no teacher support regardless there's a students forum. I'd improve the transparency and the communication teacher-student.Anyway I very happy to spent that time on this course he explains really paciently :D",4
100443,"Interesting course, provides a good insight for beginners. Wish there were more assignments and multi choice quizzes.",4
2616,"The video presentation at the end isn't what I would expect/want from an online course. I stopped short of the final project, but the course was otherwise useful.",4
88934,Useful and simple. All things that a philosophy student needs.,4
93748,This course should have more assignments of R Programming. Remaining are good.,4
19238,"I am absolutely delighted to have had the opportunity to study the fundamentals of music theory from a prestigious university such as The University of Edinburgh for free online. I extend my most sincere gratitude to Coursera and the professors teaching the course for making this possible. The course makes it very easy to build knowledge going from week to week. The assignments are all challenging. In this way this course encourages studying to understand the concepts. I have attended the course as a beginner in music theory, having encountered only some very elementary concepts earlier. I have found all the teachers to be very pleasant and very clear in their explanations. I have given 4 stars to this course because I would have liked to learn more from the professors on some topics which were very briefly mentioned. Some of the courses have external links to Wikipedia instead of a more clear explanation. This are however the exception and not the rule. The majority of the course is well taught and presented.",4

13635,"The course itself has been really useful, although I'm not sure it has taught me much that is truly new. What It has done, though, is to fill in gaps, and to give me a big helping hand into understanding how to tackle what to write about. Beforehand, I suffered somewhat from blank canvas syndrome, but this course has given me ideas to get past that. The Coursera site and app could still do with some work, since collaboration with other students is not as easy as it could",4

93106,"Good course in general. Gives a introduction to R and its basic function and structures. I recommend this courses to the ones who start using R as an analytical tool and have some basic experience with programming or data analyses. Maybe some improvement would be nice: For example, some of the assignments weren't fully consistent with coursework. However, overall a great introduction to R programming.",4
4891,"The content of this course is really interesting and intriguing, but it would better if there are additional sources and information. Also, instead of mainly picture the teacher in the video, it would be nice if there could be more graphics and diagrams to illustrate the idea that the professor is trying to convey. Besides those minor deficiencies, I would say that this is a really good course and will worth your time.",4
89825,the code shown in the video was not clear enough in some modules. Topics were explained in easy and understandable manner,4
946,As someone with only (UK) high school level maths I just about managed to follow this. I am still confused by logarithms. I guess I should go and read the maths for computer science resource.,4
38401,It's a great course and so is the book that accompanies it. However the Course and Book titles are not entirely accurate. It should be called 'An American History of Rock'. There is relatively little discussion outside of America and this is only to serve the discussion of American rock.The book in particular would benefit from a section at the end of each chapter or sidebars 'Meanwhile on the other side of the Atlantic'. As music becomes more fragmented in the 70s I imagine this criticism will become more important.Another thought would be if the Course put a play list together in 'Deezer' and 'Spotify'. That would definitely 5-star the courseStill it's a great course and I really enjoyed it.,4

100005,"simple and useful tips.the lecturer introduced importance and method for time log, prioritization, dealing with different tasks (do immediately, archive, do later, wait for other information), keeping only 1 calendar, etc.also, she introduced the ""switching cost"" concept and way to decrease it (taking notes before switching task), which is very useful",4
6585,"The course was a very comprehensive introduction to Buddhist Meditation:- there were lectures about the different Buddhist meditation traditions- practical trainings on Buddhist meditation- neurological and psychological view on the effects of meditation on the human bodyand many more topics related to meditation.I found the course was actually overloaded with content: most videos were too long and there were too many videos. Some videos were more like reading a text: the lecturer was most likely reading his own script from a Teleprompter instead of really talking to the audience. The videos were not bad, but I see some room for improvement for most videos of most lecturers. My favourite videos were from Anam Thubten, he was most genuine and convincing to me.All in all it was still an excellent introduction into the topic for me: a big thank you to all people involved, you did a great job!!",4
59557,"This is an excellent course. I'm only part way through, but I feel like I am learning a lot. It is covering the material that it promised in the outline. The pacing is right on. And I've found the quizzes and assignments have really helped me understand the material better.I only have a few minor quibbles.For one, the audio, especially in the early lectures, is rather muffled. This might make the lectures difficult to view in a noisy environment (eg. in a crowded subway car), but it is fine --though a bit of a nuisance-- in a quiet one.Another problem I've noticed is that some of the assignments are ordered in the course listing ahead of the lectures that cover the material (eg. regularization). At worst, this is a nuisance and is easy to work around -- just proceed with the lectures.Overall, I'm very glad to be taking the course and am very satisfied with it so far.",4
78988,"Solid and efficient introduction to content, does not do enough teaching in R for the final project - which is *fine* because finding things out for yourself is the best way to learn, but R help online is often so dense that it's not that helpful to a beginner. More responsive mentors - especially nearer the end of the course - would be really helpful.",4

In addition, I feel they leave too much unsaid and rely on visual comprehension far too much. I had to use the book to figure out the last two weeks. Overall, I did learn the more practical sides of hardware that other textbooks failed to convey. If they would add a Status register and break 'branching' into a separate instruction then I'd be happy with the CPU.",4

I had to learn it in semester; this course provides an interesting format and instruction (Dr. Chuck is a good teacher). This first course gives you a little back ground and it gets you started with the process of programming. I would have given the course a 5 star, but i found the book a challenge to follow for a beginner. I fumbled my way through it. only because of my past experience with FORTRAN programming.",4

Understanding the evolution of the photograph has made me more aware of what artists working in the photographic medium are trying to represent through their works.The course is not technical. It does not teach how to compose or develop a photograph. Rather, it is a lesson on the history of photography and using photography creatively through alternative and creative interpretation.",4
30671,"There's some room for improvement, that's for sure. The last video was really bad, not because of the content, but because the Professor was very sloppy in her speaking.I also think there should be more practice exercises and a better way to know if the answers were correct.But overall, was very happy with it.",4

But unlike other Coursera courses, I never did see any replies from a staff member to any of the questions posted on the forums. Other professors on Coursera reply to threads themselves or have a TA reply for them. I understand that one person may not be able to reply to all threads if the forum is active. But at least those asking questions to get clarification about the assignments should be answered. The class forum was not very active during this session and could have been easily watched more closely by one person.",4

67314,"Great course to start learning about consumer neuroscience, the drop-down is that the videos are extremely superficial while the readings (included inside the compendium) are highly technical and advanced",4
27442,"Actually, this course is a great one to take. Professors have explained these concepts and main ideas very clearly, therefore students can understand it very easily, even if they do not have previous knowledge about game theory. I want to say “thank you” to all the three professors for making such a concise and intelligible course.However, I would like to give some suggestions about this course. There is an obvious gap between the quizzes and graded assignments. Sometimes the quiz is very easy and it just requires you to have a basic understanding of the concept, while the assignment is even more difficult than the examples included in the videos. I think this course would be better if the staff can improve the difficulty gap between quizzes and assignments. And for people who want to enroll this course, an exercise book with detailed solution would be helpful for you to learn it better.As for the content of this course, there are lots of formulas from Week 5 to the end, which are a little difficult to understand. I fully understand this because math is always abstract, and formulation is an essential part of it. I think this problem can be solved by providing more ungraded quizzes for students to practice. They can have a better comprehension of the content through practicing.Anyway, this course is worth taking. Through learning it you will gain not only the knowledge about game theory, but also a new way to understand relationships around you. Happy learning!",4

The materials were well organized, easy to follow and helpful in learning the theories presented. The content was great.One element of the course structure I don't care for is the peer graded assignments. I completed the four week course in 7 days (I was on vacation), but I've had to wait three more weeks for everyone else to catch up with me so I can grade their assignments. (You can't progress until you've graded three other students.) I also do not like that the grading is not blind, so you know exactly how your peers graded you and they know how you graded them. Not sure that merits the most honest grading results. If you grade someone honestly and they feel it was unfair or harsh, they may grade you harshly the next time. A blind system would allow honest feedback and ensure more truthful grading.",4

77033,"As someone with no introduction to programming at all, this course was easy to follow through and was a pretty good introductory course!",4
71446,"Great course and very helpful. The following details prevent me from giving it a 5 stars review:* the explanation of the tools to use during the course is very messy. It may discourage people that are less used to work their way around searching working tools.* The audio of the videos sometimes loses A LOT of quality.* For me it seemed like all the assignments were on spot with the balance between theory and standalone thinking. However, I really noticed the jump of time invested for the last assignment. I think the course would highly benefit from having an assignment on Week 5, instead of having that pause in between.Anyway, the course was greatly structured and interesting. Can't wait to go on with the whole specialization!",4

101132,"This is it! This was the last course in the Robotics Specialization. I must say this was the most interesting course in this specialization, there are 2 tracks available to choose from: a software one and a hardware one. Needless to say I chose the latter. I think pretty much anyone doing a robotics specialization should opt for this one if they have the means. It is nice to simulate different scenarios and learn different concepts through them, however, nothing beats the joy of building something by yourself and witnessing the fruits of your hard work, it is really rewarding!My main and only complaint about this course is related to the grading system for the hardware track. It relies on a system of peer reviews by 3 other students. Sometimes the results might not be fair, and you will need to resubmit your work because of that.",4

39518,"Great course for those looking for a fast-track brief on IoT and AR. The course offers a very quick and concise view of both IoT and AR technologies and their industry applications.Some of the basic architecture for both IoT and AR is very useful information for future reference and for accelerated learning.However, some of the training content (only about 10%) may be better absorbed with some formal knowledge of communication and networking systems. To state a couple of examples - IoT talks about 'packet' distribution which is a core networking topic and anyone with no prior background may struggle to fully grasp it. Similarly, some of the technicalities of image scanning in AR could have been left out in my opinion. Having said that, none of these 'technical' aspects figure in the course quiz, which limits to testing basic functional understanding, which is what the course aims to teach.",4

65360,"The entire course took me about 8 hours to complete. The videos are on average around 10 minutes long. The first two weeks of the course were very introductory and had they stayed that way I would have been disappointed (however they were focused on my specialization). Week 3 and 4 made it worth it for me and were very helpful (computing technology and statistics). I thought the course project could have been better. I didn't feel it was a strong overview of what I learned about the course. Either way, I'm glad I went through the entire thing.",4
17044,"I preferred the third course that emphasized practical application in the specialization over the second course that was mostly theory. The assignments were geared to engage your insights / ideas about what you know and/or are learning about real-life projects. Although it still only scratches the surface, I liked the ability to apply some of the assignments to a company with which I've been working.",4
84163,Easy way to learn python,4
17113,"Good intro to implement marketing analytics principal, especially lecture 5 onward.",4
22216,"There were a couple of bugs, but it was a great way to close a very well-designed course.It felt almost like a game!",4
76862,"Good basic introduction to Python. The course should be easy to understand and follow even if you are not a programmer. To top it all Chuck is an amazing teacher full or energy, enthusiasm and knowledge. His love for Python is seen in each and every chapter. I am glad that I took this course on Coursera. Will definitely recommend this to others. Would love to take the advanced part of the course soon.",4
75846,This was a good intro to programming for sure! The book is very clear and concise. There could have been more information provided each week.,4
64617,"Very interesting and intriguing, quizzes are a bit hard because they cover so much material so if you are a working individual I feel it's almost impossible to accomplish but it's nice for general knowledge.Two notes-First, it would be nice if the professor wouldn't use ""get yourself comfortable"" in the beginning of EACH video - it is a bit annoying.Second, on quizzes & tests it's recommended that you omit the sentence ""in the presentation"" that starts EVERY question/quizz/test because obviously it is based on what we are presented in the videos so it's just time consuming, in my opinion.Besides that, great for general knowledge, awesome teacher, I really enjoyed this course, thank you!",4
67159,"The course gives I think a good overview over the concepts of neural networks and the teaching material is good. However generally the course is more advanced than I suspected, so it took me much more time then what is given for the lectures / quizzes to complete it. If you are not already familiar with the concepts and/or have a strong mathematical background it can be sometimes frustrating :-)One thing that definitively needs improvement is that 2 times the questions of the quizzes were corrupted (parts were missing). Not sure if this was due to the material itself or a bug in the Cousera platform. So look in the discussion forum if you find something strange in the quizzes.",4
94515,Good course. Prof. Caffo is a great teacher! Hope to see an advanced version of RegMods soon!,4
64127,"Excellent course that is precise, specific and unbiased.",4
71530,"Good materials and challenging programming exercises. Makes you think. However some material is old and some new, so little confusing. Especially when going through the materials about installing the development environment.",4
24556,Very well structured and presented - and great supporting notes,4
60370,Excellent course. It is applicable in many areas as our modern world is adding up complexity about everywhere and everyday in our lives. The course provides excellent perspectives of thinking and good exercisedecision,4
104730,Great course. Fantastic lecturers and the whole approach of the course on how to tackle important decisions when there is an ethical side.,4
29971,"Great course, but can be somewhat dry at times. Yet, highly recommended!",4
95869,Course is good and they are working hard on having advisors available.,4
13404,"This is an excellent course that will teach you plethora of new things! The only gotcha is that things move too fast in the world of Data Science. Some of the topics and code might not work exactly as shown when you take the course, and many things will change. It's up to the student to make-up for the missing pieces, but I guess that is the only caveat when you work in a still-evolving field.",4
71586,Very good content and essentially methodology of applying the knowledge learnt in real life cases,4
2462,The more complex functions in Tableau could be explained better.,4
105727,Very good course! The only thing that i must criticise is that in many weekly tests there are mistakes. This can get a little bit frustrating,4
42192,"Overall another great learning opportunity. Appreciate the relevant models and templates to aid in identifying and coaching top talent. 4 stars as there are some opportunities to improve the delivery of the first lesson and I am not a fan of video tape assignments. That said, would highly recommend - the course learnings are incredibly relevant and will support you in making a difference in the work lives and careers of your team.",4
103456,"Excellent course, well explained. Not too much things to learn at once. Ideal when you want to start. Would be useful to have also a slide deck next to it for the review and exam preparation.",4
75655,Nice course but you need to be patient while doing the exercise.,4
79386,3 stars for the content and the fourth stars because the way the instructor presented it was amusing.,4
12487,Over all the class was great and I learned new things and tried techniques I have always wanted to use but didn't know how. I really wish there was a way to see all the of the submissions for the peer review once we have handed our assignment in and have finished reviewing the minimum requirement. I think a lot can be learned by seeing how everyone else in the class interpreted the assignment. It would be fun to see what everyone else photographed.,4
101913,A very good introduction when you are a total learner in this field! For those who already have some expertise it is good to up to date!! I did enjoy it despite my lack of time :-),4
26775,The HTML/CSS part of this lecture are really amazing (5 star I would say). I felt that the JS parts were a bit rushed through and probably needed a separate course. I am also working on the side (as a backend engineer) and got the chance to apply whatever I learnt and not rely on our front-end engineer so it was great. Thanks for the course leader and the course providers for my first step towards becoming a full-stack engineer!,4
62045,Great Course!,4
32246,"It is good that the professor was able to connect physical laws to day-to-day events and phenomena and help laymen like myself understand them through simple, less technical explanations.However, it would be better if the questions in the quizzes can be explained after attempts. Though I could retake the tests, sometimes, it is through sheer trial and error that I got some answers correct. In this way, true learning is not achieved.It would be good if the answers to the quizzes could be re-explained with parts of the lesson vides to draw the links. Sometimes, that link is not obvious. It is not immediately clear which part of the lesson pertained to which quiz questions and that made reviewing the lessons after getting answers wrong not helpful.I speak from a perspective of a student who has not taken physics since 14th grade.",4
53787,Thorough introduction into machine learning. Programming exercises could provide less pre-written code and require to write more functions (i.e. visualizing data) by yourself.,4
2805,This course is fitted for me who want to self study.,4
45966,EXCELLENT COURSE ABOUT IMPROVE LEARNING. I like Course put subtitles in Spanish language. Sometimes I can not understand all the American English and I check it in the subtitles.,4
10002,Very good overview of modern astronomy. Easy to understand by non native English speaker.,4
89794,In my opinion that this course can help any one that want to know about the financing and diversification ..,4
30164,we need to ask the instructor,4
40856,This course has provided me with a good and simple understanding on the concept,4
66321,"A reasonable walkthrough of typical tools for photo editing. Only thing I'd like to add is a walkthrough of a simple typical photo editing workflow (like cropping, WB, coarse tone adjustment, tone curve, sharpening & consumption format rendering).",4
86232,"Very helpful and inspiring course. Dr. McGarrity with a great sense of humor give all the support needed to get over your fears, to stand up in front of a lens, and to deliver a self-confidence speech. But more important, he gives a great example and guideline on how to prepare it. Highly recommended MOOC.",4
52501,"Very good course, very good professors; no community assistants for answering in the discussions.",4
68080,"I really enjoyed the overall materials and especially loved the way they split the course into two sections:Theory and Programming.However, i wish they were using more standard packages such as pandas, or skit-learn instead of graphlab. It was a good class to taste what is going on in the world of ML.",4
33875,Really enjoyed the challenges it made me face with designing my own booklet.Has inspired me to do more.,4
91249,very good online course. I personally learned a lot.,4
66649,Good way to learn how to present an art work and express personal interpretation.,4
52306,"what a golden opportunity given by' almighty' coursera to train teachers to rather become professional teachers !!!.....wow coursera, you are perfectly the best .",4
98051,"I thought this course did a fine job of breaking down foundational concepts from the field sustainability in an understandable manner. The right combination of coursework, readings, and lecture for me.",4
91026,Thank you!,4
39419,"Descriptive, easy to understand concept, simple language was the highlight of the lectures. More examples on aspects that are complex would be highly appreciated.",4
5843,"The accent from teachers would be a little bit annoying, also the fact that most of the topics (incomes, outcomes from the programs) are unclear for a naive student. But for the rest, is a great way to introduce programming.",4
6318,"Interesting, thank you for making this course available. After taking it I transitioned from being pescetarian to vegan and I wish that more controversial animal rights concerns were more focused on.",4
42272,"Great course, I would definitely recommend. Information flowed smoothly and it was a great way for me to learn and understand my leadership style. The only reason I gave it a 4 star and not 5 is because during the peer assessment I kept being matched to persons who were in a different time zone from me which made it difficult for us to communicate. Other than that 1 glitch, thoroughly enjoyed the course.",4
87893,"These courses are great introductions to python functionality. The workload is much more reasonable at 1-2 hours per week than many other Coursera courses that I have taken.My only recommendation is to show more current libraries and methods than those presented in the lectures. Fundamentals are important to understanding concepts, but if there are newer and better ways of doing things, they should be presented as well.",4
58113,"Really good course. Interesting topics, and good assignments.",4
93,good introduction!!!,4
5797,"I think that some assignations are too difficult, and some indeed few explanations are poor",4
79749,"The course covers very detailed introduction of the iOS development and Object-C language. However, in the demo, sometimes the instructor didn't mention why we are doing that, or using a verbose way to solve the problem (e.g., not using for loop).",4
25594,"This course has made me more thoughtful and analytical, about things I did not really look at previously. Plus I learned to use Twine, it is a great tool.",4
53373,Very simple and mathematically unsophisticated (which could be a good or bad thing depending on your background) but well-organised and a generally worthwhile introduction. I'd recommend watching the videos sped up to 1.5x or 2x if you're comfortable with the mathematics since the pace of the videos is otherwise too slow.,4
70377,"The material is explained really well, and there are many concepts that are introduced that it helps set a good foundation in OOP. The project is pre-built which is the only thing that I didn't enjoy a lot, I would have preferred starting everything from scratch as I think it would help cement the stuff learnt even more.",4
17319,"There are some inconsistencies in the course or the arrangement of the videos, maybe due to technical problems.For improvement I would really wish to have some substantial results, especially in the last week of the course. That is, I would prefer to discuss at least something in depth rather than everything broadly.",4
7177,Very well explained,4
12135,"Overall very detailed and informative. A great way to get insight into English Common Law. I just felt that in the last week (6), perhaps the transcripts in English had a few mistakes and seemed to be missing out a few words of the lecturer. Also a few grammatical mistakes, which seemed slightly odd? Nevertheless. Very happy ultimately.",4
67084,"This is a great course overall, even though it is a bit dated and a lot of more recent developments are not covered. There was also a mistake in one of the quizes, where they forget to mention that the values of the variables should be changed. Fortunately, someone realized that the new values were given in an old version of the quiz.",4
17903,"Very interesting, but Capstone is much more difficult than the rest of the course.Be sure to study carefully the first courses, and don't rush.",4
66804,"I liked too much the way Rhiannon explained thw best practices to manage and create our measurement and marketing plans, and how to develop them in every digital asset we have available now.",4
54137,Very well explained. I was able to follow easily. The basics are there. The tutorials were very valuable. Would be nice if the cours was updated by more modern topics like deep learning.,4
75973,"Easy and interesting, but the content is a little bit thin..",4
24303,it OK.,4
11773,An excellent course totally recomendable. Very clear and focused.,4
61530,"It's a great topic, but some topics and links are off to date, You need to update some topics and links.Also the Professor Rhiannon Clifton should try to read less and explain a little bit more.But in general, it was a good course, I learned a lot.",4
95420,"Good introductory course, but I must admit that the assignments are not explained well enough.",4
87992,"Thank you so much for this course, I really enjoyed it!I only gave 4 stars because sometimes it is really hard to understand, especially key words (I am not talking about the accent but the group and family latin names, etc); I constantly had to check the subtitles for these.To be honest I wasn't expecting this content after reading the course title, but it was nice to see evolution from this point of view, great job!",4
64177,"Very informative course, but it would be better with more multimedia materials to make the history more interesting.",4
34797,Great course for the beginners !,4
39051,"Good. Probably could use more assignments or links to further tutorials. The final assignment's instructions as they are written mislead English as a Second Language students to use methods that don't contribute to the functionality required in the script.A prior review from a longterm coder who was previously apprehensive of JavaScript before taking this course echoes 80% of my sentiments. This is a gentle but robust introduction for the intimidated, and success in this course is a confidence boost.",4
37768,Excellent very good introduction especially recommended javascript,4
35803,"A very interesting course. Only negative thing is that some of the authors are not very good at leading a lecture, and seem to stumble in their words a lot.",4
49807,Basic stuff but informative,4
84762,"Good entry-level course, i used it to refresh some basic python knowledge for 3rd course",4
28786,Lectures are short and engaging. Good info. Great prof! Would like a little more evidence for some of the concepts presented but overall GREAT!,4
48796,Good course. Good content. A bit of a repetition if you have an MBA. Overall good content.,4
24948,Great explanations for most subjects. The tests are significantly more complicated than the excercises covered by the lectures.,4
90214,A well thought course on the composition of items. The main strength is that it is supported both by the expertise of the speakers and academic literature.,4
68083,"This was a great specialisation taught by great professors, but I'm very frustrated that the final segment on deep learning was never finished! Coursera needs to fill this gap since it is hugely important topic and isn't covered adequately in any other Coursera material right now.",4
93701,"A quick warm up course for new learner in R. I spent a week to went through the course material and most of the experiment/programming tasks. Now feel quite comfortable to basic R. The course might be improved if more time are spent on some concrete case studies. Some useful functions/routines like str, csv header preprocessing are very handy and it is great to learn these. The last part, debug and profile seem not big concerns for new learners.",4
37188,Courses can be a bit more detailed.,4
36151,Great course. Introduction to financial markets and regulations. Professor Shiller es clear and didactic.,4
76687,very nicely explained basics of python ...,4
14571,Great course that allows an introduction into the world of the data scientist. Some instructional videos could be improved.,4
104198,"Very useful to develop worlds and enviroments, not only for videogames, but for all kind of media.",4
95491,"I like the content covered in the lectures. That's very useful for me to clean data parsed from webpages. There is one thing I hope the course can improved, which probably has been mentioned in the forum for many times: the auto-grader is not flexible that it doesn't grant any points to answers that is slightly different from the submitted form (e.g. upper/lower cases, white space, etc.) and we have a hard time figuring out what exactly the auto-grader is accepting. I would suggest modifying the auto-grader such that it allows flexibility in answer acceptance, or breaking down questions into smaller parts (more partial credits) and give more precise/detailed description on the format of answer expected.",4
14904,"This was a very professionally done course. It is *very* introductory, which is either good or bad, depending on how you feel about it.",4
81788,"Well course, well explained. It starts from the very basics for those ones that does not know much about web development.",4
85769,I have learned a lot in this course and it will help me in my new career in Project Management thank you to the professor,4
23929,"More in-depth work with ArcMap and associated principles. Redundant to a degree with the intro to the specialization, but good blend of instruction and assignments.",4
52270,"It's such a nice good Course. It focuses on the essentials of Lesson Design and Assessment. As a novice English Teacher, I'd highly recommend this course.",4

23053,Excellent course with simple language and a wealth of information.,4
31351,Course was good but I thought more could of been added to the content to make more understandable. For ex. videos,4
14143,"Very nice introduction! Unlike a lot of online courses, this course is no fluff or jargon. It is solid stuff with hands on experience. I only wished this course was longer. After completing the 10-week Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, this course felt a bit too short. :-)",4
100451,"This was a great introductory course. I particularly appreciated the text book chapter being included as it was a really useful resource. Compared to some other Coursera courses (quantitative and qualitative research methods) there were many fewer lectures and resources. That's why I rated it a 4/5. I'm getting more out of the other two, but this was a fantastic introduction to get me thinking.",4
76526,"Very nice professor, liked him very much. My favorite thing about the course.",4
18593,"So far I enjoyed and learned to many concepts about programing, I have none technical background so for me this is like learning a complete new language with different alphabet, they explain in a clear way, with examples and easy language, the Javascript part could be more specific but it is fine.",4
30386,"I would like to thank the course Instructors, It is really fruitful and enjoyable.",4
15457,"Not all the parts are useful for European construction market, but it's very good quality information. Thank you!",4
59472,"There should be more multiple choice questions; 20+ instead of just 5 questions.There should be more MCQ tests. 5+ instead of just one.There should be more assignments. 3+ instead of just one. Make it one easy, one medium and one hard.There should be more optional assignments. 5+ instead of just one.I know you guys are working hard as it is, but we learn by doing, not by listening or watching. Just food of thought.",4
99128,VEry informative and excellent course.,4
99889,Short and sweet course that verbalizes and echos thoughts at work about productivity.,4
81705,As basics it was good.,4
15242,"The course content is very useful, but explanations are short and It's unclear how to install R studio for the Windows (I found it at Youtube). Also I had a problem how to install the R packages, and solution was simple: you should run it as administrator (it wasn't in lecture).",4
73530,professor peter navarro is the best :),4

9777,"Some tasks was hard to understand and solve, but it in general it was good.",4
36514,"This is an interesting introductory course on finance. I enjoyed Professor Shiller's style of delivery. Some of the quantitative analysis, although limited, appeared to assume some additional knowledge of the subject matter. The video editing could be improved, particularly in the earlier lectures where some of the quiz questions where not covered in the online lectures.",4
103620,It seems to be good introduction to get to know basics of UX. I would it be a little bit more attractive and enjoyable but all in all it's good as first step to UX.,4

43793,the course introduced me to different concepts about learning and it was overall quite interesting.,4
105091,very useful course,4
12959,The lectures are brief and a lot of readings on the reference materials are needed.,4
22882,"This course is good for basics for Non finance professionals. Topics should have bee covered more in detail and totality. For examples Accounting principles coverd only 6 or 7 principles, while there are more principles.",4
5976,"This is an awesome Course. I'd like that the failed tests, of the submitted programs, to be shown, in order to have a better idea where you are doing wrong.",4
15144,"Great introduction to the different tools that a data scientist will encounter and use, including RStudio, Git, and GitHub. I would have appreciated more practical experience linking Git and GitHub, as that is critical for version control of code.",4
79845,For Project initial planning & understanding it is very helpful. The course has the scope of all aspects with key knowledge.,4
97941,Simply great!,4
10137,"Great lectures. However, the starter code for the programming assignment is quite atrocious. Overall, would highly recommend to anyone wanting to learn high level concepts in distributed systems.",4
2038,The relational schema for the dognition database should have been provided.,4
12347,Peers review is not that positive as people are not that fair.,4
65187,"Great start to rails, provided a practical intro. Could have used a little more frequent practice actually writing code.",4
97908,"Interesting course with well-organized lectures and graphics. I enjoyed the diversity of case studies, and especially hearing about countries other than the US and organizations other than large corporations with big budgets. The practice grading of the final project was well done and illuminating. It was effective in helping me understand the grading criteria better.It would be helpful if the printouts were 1 slide per page, as on the page the type is small and difficult to read. Small, weekly assignments such as posting a reflection question in the forum could be helpful. One guest presenter spoke too quickly, so I was thankful for the transcript.It would be nice if those auditing the course could also participate in the final assignment w/ peer feedback.",4
106711,"Very well researched and articulate professor, incredibly knowledgeable.",4

90698,"The material is very informative and generally well presented. I would have liked more video explanation about the minimum snap trajectories as this was a large part of the final assignment.If the Matlab resource was an actual desktop application instead of online, the assignments would have been much easier and quicker to accomplish. Matlab online, in my experience, is slow and hard to work with in a single browser window.Overall, I enjoyed this course.",4

97799,Thought provoking!,4
63666,"This is a very basic course in using the arduino and having it communicate with various other devices. It is not a bad thing to have such a basic course exist, it is a good thing, but there are definite flaws in the course, the main ones being the grading system for the assignments and the lack of a place to go for clarification of the assignment / grading questions.Both the penultimate and the final assignments require a certain amount of extra research and learning beyond what was taught in the lectures and yet the grading instructions for the assignments did not allow for taking that into account; the grading criteria was either binary (grade of 100%, or 0) or had the possibility of a partial passing grade but without listing a number of possible criteria that would put a project into the partial passing grade category.",4
98843,"The course is challenging, but the professor is really awesome.",4
69119,"Very well structured, I'm really looking forwards to the next courses.I like how they always start from a real-life, down-to-earth example and work their way up to the technical bits. Everything is clear and explained in detail, and often multiple solutions are proposed: e.g. 'we do A, but this has the problem blah, so we do B..' super good, comparison is the key for understanding. Python notebook is an amazing pedagogical tool, and I really appreciate how the exercises are designed: first go through pre-made code, then tinker to get a few variations.I would like to see a bit more of the 'algorithms' (e.g. could outliers make centroids drift away in kNN? what is the computational complexity of the various functions we're using?) but it's just a minor remark.Way to go guys!",4

78780,Very helpful.,4
58304,"Thanks a lot Andrew NG for one of the best and most descriptive online courses I took so far. Just as a small point open to improvement, in MATLAP/Octave assignments, students may be encouraged more to apply the core steps of the algorithms on their own.",4
3580,I think it would be better if the lectures can go a little bit deeper on the topics in this course.,4

97647,"The course is good and offers some interesting insights into the current state of things regarding terrorism, as well as a glimpse in the mindset of the terrorists and terrorist organizations.",4
8344,very good introduction.,4
47390,"It's apparently not true that ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks!"" I learned a lot in this course, I just wish I could have taken it when I was 40 years younger. Well worth the time invested, and I hope to use some of the techniques in the near future.",4
90159,"A great course on Motion Planning for systems, I enjoyed it. I got stuck a few times during assignments, but due to a great community, I was able to pull through and gain a better understand of the course.",4

64829,"Superb presentation of objective methods to approach negotiations, with exercises and",4
30106,very helpful!,4
758,"content was not as interesting as in the first course, but still good overall. Questions were also less analytical challenging as the first course. But I still enjoyed the course as the professor was explaining the subject clearly and the videos were compact and enjoyable.",4
7210,So useful and focus on main basic aspects.,4
72017,It is a very good course so far. Thank you so much for the opportunity to take it. (:,4
67642,This course is very interesting because it brings important data and information about managment waste and recycling.,4
72410,The professor did a great job simplifying the material down. The short videos really helped me get acclimated to the format of Coursera. The examples were very clear and easy to understand.,4
68418,"Many practical examples for usages of machine learning.Almost concepts, no hard math works.Recommend for beginners who interested in machine learning but did not have any math background.",4
22130,great learned a lot .,4
2290,"Very well-presented course with excellent illustrations. Gives a good overview on addiction with pharmacology, with good links to further reading. I found the title slightly misleading though, as the course presented very little information on brain physiology except for the dopamine receptors.",4
32121,"VERY good content and classes! Some questions in the quizzes are confusing, and there was the trouble with the required reading for Week 3. The first Honors assignment is confusing - specially its very last input question.",4
45086,It was a good course and helped me out of misconceptions i had about ways of learning and also helped to re-enforced some of my own belief systems. I specially liked the section on procrastination and how to handle the same. I will definitely try to imbibe some of the learning in my professional life and as far as possible will try to disseminate the learnings with others.,4
68824,I found this to be an excellent course. Both the instructors are excited about the work they are doing and do a good job of teaching the materials. I don't have a statistics background and college calculus is more than a little fuzzy. I was still able to understand most of the course.,4
59009,"Very well structured course. Professor is excellent. Lecture videos are easy to understand, have good examples, and are well organized. The assignments are relevant and illustrate the process of actually running machine learning.However, the scope of topics does feel a bit too ""intro/basic"" and the material and assignments feel spoonfed. It would have been great if the course went deeper into each topic and also challenged the student to do more coding independently in Octave/Matlab.",4
49501,I really enjoyed this course. I liked the forced research into micro-controllers and embedded systems.I would however like to stress that the use of peer reviewed assignments slows the pace of the class down greatly. People sometimes like to progress a lot faster. Difficult to do when waiting for others.,4
104835,"This was the toughest of all the Data Science courses so far. Without the statistical inference book, the practical exercises and the swirls it would have been very challenging to pass the course. These were very valuable tools. The videos that are available when I couldn't get a practical exercise right, also helped me a lot.I majored in mathematical statistics 40 years ago, but have never used it in my whole career. But in my opinion this course explained the concepts much better than how it was done 40 years ago. Congratulations to everybody involved.I have learned so much and was really proud of myself when I passed this one.",4
80805,"From every lesson, I learn things that not only applicable in negotiation but also in daily life. Thank you.",4

86799,Great course for those who are complete beginners! the exercises are a bit too easy,4
80313,"Course goes over the most basic points, but also allows you (if you are interested) to dive much deeper into the content. Seems it has everything any project manager would want, so definitely worth taking. Would have wanted the questions to be a little more difficult and potentially more questions to help make sure the information was retained. Overall a great course.",4
42497,"Very interesting course, which has helped me be more cognizant of how I'm processing things. It also confirmed some beliefs I have about how my mind works (which is just like everyone else's!).",4
100138,"It has very useful tips on how to work smarter, not harder. I love this course, especially multitasking part. I have learned so much. Thanks!",4

4585,It's very useful to learn how excel able to handle different mathematical models,4
15159,"The Data Scientist’s Toolbox is a great way to dip into Data Science and the methodology behind it. The course is very general, and makes an effort to cover the bigger scope of things without delving deep in any. More than anything, it's a great way to learn the components and uses of data science and set a framework for all that will be coming after.The materials are very well laid-out and almost feel like attending college classes. The visuals and slides are a little dry, but the pace is lively enough to maintain momentum at all times.",4
83156,"The course achieves its objectives, but the assignments require too much effort for solving general problems, and relatively little for parallelism-related tasks. In other words, understanding what the problem is takes far more time than solving it. The Lego-assisted teaching is a definite plus though!",4
9800,"Nice introduction into string algorithms, even though Ukkonen's algorithm is missing and slides sometimes contain buggy pseudocode.",4
60045,"I give this course 4 stars as I did learn a lot from it, and thought most of it is well prepared and useful.I found some disappointment in some of the programming assignments where I wanted to understand the code better but it was not documented properly. In such cases the common response was that the material goes beyond the scope of the course.I thank Andrew Ng for the material and hope this gets resolved in the future.",4
90092,Could be improved. There is more need of involvement of mentors and TAs.,4
91018,"All the information and content given is great and necessary to work with mongo db. unfortunately, the timing and pacing is really tough because it relies on pretty long assignments. Take this course if you can handle going through 20 pages of instructions for a homework or 2, or you need a fast paced review of mongo and mongoid coupled with rails.",4
24103,"Very basic stuff, but informative.",4
20233,This was a very interesting course. It presented a new way of looking at emotions I had not thought of before and the lectures were fun and interesting. The quizzes could have been a bit more challenging. Excellent forum participation from the mentors/staff.,4

15824,It could be a good review for me. I did this course before. Thanks!,4
14606,"The course itself only introduces the main aspects and helps with installation of the tools, while no actual programming is taught. But it is useful for having better understanding of the following courses in the specialization.",4

93586,"Excellent environment to get acquinted with R. Specifically the Swirl programme inside R is really helpful and will get you the basics of how you can work in R in a very efficient way.For me, as a clinical researcher, some more information on how to clean your data and run your analysis would be very useful but this course is mostly focussed on programming your own functions.",4
75680,"Good introduction to Python, it gets you into the mindset of programming and combining syntax to do something useful. The videos could be more to the point and better quality though.",4
14259,This is a good intro to programming so far. It feels like I'm building a solid base from which to understand R.,4
28656,"This course provided an insight to the ultimate aim of human life - Happiness. In order to reach that dream, you need to take certain actions, it speaks about those. More than anything, it urges you to be open minded to everything.",4
87331,"It's a very practical course. The course is in a good pace. The contents are broken into smaller pieces. Thank you Dr. Chunk for making Python+WebData easy and fun to learn. One little thing I wish was the slides and code could be shown for a longer time, or constantly showing on the screen as the two earlier python course. Currently I had to pause the video couple times to digest the slides or code.",4

69535,Very useful for getting started in Mandarin!,4
1892,"This is a very quick and effective class to teach you the language and concepts within business metrics. You will also hear descriptions of data-related jobs - what are the roles and differences in skills applied - and these jobs are fairly universal across all industries. The portion of this course that could be better is when the professor throws a bunch of math into the content. It is basically irrelevant to this course, and in and of itself it is so rushed and introduced so out of context that it is very confusing.",4
27729,"A comprehensive introduction to the subject, somewhat spoiled by the unrelenting reiteration of the most basics concepts in the earlier parts of the course. A bit of a pity, since the lecturer is a fairly engaging speaker when he is not busy interrupting the flow of his argument with mind–numbing repetition.",4
71416,"I really enjoyed the assignments, and thought they were a good way to get to know the basics of the language. They were similar to the type of ""toy problem"" that I like to do myself when learning another language, and were at a reasonable level of difficulty.I could have done without the proofs; I sort of skipped over these parts (about an hour of lecture, I guess). That's just my preference - I guess I'm not super proofy.There were very minor parts of the course that need updating, but nothing that required additional effort to get past.",4
96575,"This course was pretty cool. A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a ""mental framework"" for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework/lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself. Many of the homework assignments took me under an hour -- after I spent hours watching all the videos and taking notes trying to remember it all.",4
32690,Great course. Unfortunately it is not so in the deep as hoped.,4
54598,"For a student major in Literature, this video turns out to be very interesting and insightful, besides it is not too difficult.",4
76980,"I recommend this course to those who totally do not have any experience in programming. Otherwise, it is too simply to follow the lecture step by step. All the programming language are quite similar at the first beginning, like matlab or C++.",4
25941,great start for any one who would like to build his own game,4
71350,This course gives a very nice introduction to Functional Programming whilst introducing you to the idiosyncrasies of the Scala language.,4
4779,This class is filled with useful information and the outside resources it references are also great. The material in the class is presented in a clear and compassionate manner. It's a class worth taking to better understand AIDS/HIV and the role the disease plays throughout the world.,4
2253,"Not too comprehensive, but an overall good course.",4
35839,A very nice introduction. The instructor shows a lot of enthusiasm for the subject. The exercises help reinforce the material.,4
99672,Several problems with the student assessment.,4
36535,"I would like to give this course 5 stars because Robert Shiller is such amazing teacher and lecturer, but I have to give it 4 stars because as is the lectures are not very well edited. A lot of content was left out, and some of the quizzes test material that is not even in the course.",4
84147,very well taught of the concepts broken down as chapters and put together to understand and think the logic behind programming.,4
22217,Thanks for coming up with a near real-life problem. I understand a lot of effort goes in creating these problems.,4
29187,Wonderful logical explanation of the new dog cognition theory. I'm excited to see how this knowledge & research will affect dog training in the future.,4
9727,Some parts of the course were either not well explained or too rudimentary in relation to the quizzes.,4
67095,"The content presented in this course is really complete and well presented. It is definitively worth taking. Unfortunately, there were a few organization errors like missing video and quizzes errors. On a side note, it's great to be able to learn from Hinton since he has created many of the techniques presented in the course.",4
38023,Good course! Thanks!,4
6795,Fun course to take. Makes you realize how much we depend on abstraction in our world. A few notes on documentation (your own code) and version-control would complete it...,4
36635,Some videos seem truncated. Cut off and start too abruptly.,4
55711,This course is very suitable for beginner in the field of Machine Learning.It help me to understand some basic knowledge in this filed.Thanks very much!,4
96496,Good but the assignments are minor changes instead of full blown impls,4
67201,Very interesting material covered and in-depth views. Unfortunately a few technical issues in quizzes.,4
7319,Enjoyed it but perhaps a little too basic for my needs. Still would recommend if you are not familiar with nutrition.,4

81950,Simplified and well presented!A big thank you to the instructors :),4
49999,"It was a really helpful course! I had previous experience in programming (I have written scripts in Fortran), but having the opportunity to learn a much modern language such as Python was really entertaining.The assignments were made so that I could utilize each lesson and so did each quiz.I would firmly recommend this course to people with little to none programming knowledge!",4
62244,Great course that gives a fresh look on marketing.Although few exercises should be reviewed and updated.,4
40962,Good Course to understand basics of Game designing,4
69862,The entire course is an overview! This course will be a revision if you already know the concepts.,4
86168,Good introduction course with great lecturer.,4
28739,"Thank you! I enjoyed the content and learning more about happiness. I found the music a wee bit corny, though.",4
72803,"Courses like this are always difficult to judge because of the great variety of students coursera reaches. That is, some class members finished this course in the first week it was open, others still struggled till the last minute. For some the math was too simply, for others the python programming was too confusing. All in all it strikes a reasonable balance between novice learners and more advanced students.What the course could stand to really benefit from is some kind of repository of code, for those students who successfully completed the assignments to compare to their own. It seems pretty clear that there are some advanced python users whose insights could help improve one's coding skills.",4
64987,"Definitely recommend if you need a crash-course on Ancient Egypt! In-depth, concise, and well explained; suitable for all those interested in ancient history",4
36547,All the Course material is available online on other websites and it is kind of very old,4
75615,GOOD COURSE! CLEAR AND WELL ORGANIZED!!!,4
20714,A great resource or as a reminder from previous material!!,4
35250,"A good course with clear instructional materials and excellent presentation. However the reason it does not get 5 stars is that when I signed up to the GIS specialisation in April 2016 I was led to believe that course instructors would review my capstone project. Indeed, this was one of the incentives for me in signing on to the specialisation. I realise that with the number of students undertaking the course this did not become very practical, so that the capstone project was peer reviewed instead. I found this somewhat disappointing though as the feedback gained was often quite limited and it reduced the value of the Certificate.",4
95072,The video classes are informative and very clear. The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace. My only problem were the auto-graded exams. Sometimes the questions are not crystal clear and the auto-grader isn't intelligent enough to discern between a logical mistake and some detail about table formatting. Fortunately these problems are discussed in the forums and usually one can get clues on what they can be from the mentors.,4
20982,Good course. Basic level.,4
99052,"This course is really Interesting, i am so glad i did this course.",4
19457,Enjoyed learning about the Rate to Ratio and Cumulative Distribution fuctions,4
82867,"The content is great. But there's not a lot of activity on the discussion boards, and there are some technical issues with the quizzes (using future lesson material on current quizzes). But the content is really fascinating.",4
90779,"I really enjoyed this course and it really hooked me onto this topic, definitely this will not be the last robotics course I am going to follow. That being said there are some points of improvement.The main parts necessary to program the simulation assignments are covered in the materials, but there are still some of them that need to be pursued independently. Some assumptions have to be made that are not so obvious, I do not know whether it is the intention of this course to do so or not, but since they are minor footnotes that may hinder completely your results, I think they should be made explicit.The Matlab files available for the course work as intended, what is not so obvious though is how they are intended to work, that is because there is very little documentation about them, it would be great if there was more documentation available, especially for people who have never used such tools before.Finally, even though I personally enjoyed this course and I think it had an achievable level of challenge for me, I would definitely not recommend this course for total beginners, or people who do not have followed a math, physics or engineering degrees. The way the course is laid out, even if you do not understand the concepts behind each topic you will still manage to answer the quizzes and get the simulations to work eventually, however to truly understand what they mean and be able to replicate them in other environments requires some prior knowledge that cannot be taught in just a few hours.",4
5822,Programming assignments are well structured in such a way that it encourages one to continuously improve upon the solution.,4
17344,Interesting intro to some powerful ideas,4
21712,Some of the exams are hard so you need to be on your game for this one.,4
97597,"This is a great overview of terrorism and counter-terrorism, and identifies the many flaws due to lack of knowledge policymakers still make in dealing with this phenomena. The rigor of the course is challenging but not impossible. I like that a section on Foreign Fighters has now been added to further enhance the course. I will use this knowledge to apply to another topic I am researching - gang dynamics and gang violence, which I believe shares many similarities. My only criticism is of the final, which I found to ask several questions about some obscure facts and did not truly test for the body of knowledge in my opinion, hence the 4 not 5 stars.",4
36144,"The course gives you an insight of practically almost all the aspects of finance! And that too in just 8 weeks! So kudos to that. Since this course gives a glimpse of almost everything in finance, it becomes easy for a person to choose his/her area of specialization for the future.One of the things that can improve is the subtitles (English). There are just so many errors in them.",4
39869,It is generally a good course. What I didn't like was the fact that the assignments were too hard.,4
57071,Excelent. Just the assignments are sometimes not so easy to understand.,4

23026,Thanyou for the course .its informative. I wish there is more metabolic description and consumer behaviour,4
71168,This course was great for developing new brain connections. It was sometimes frustrating - In particular with the very limited discussion threads available on the forum (I wonder if it would be possible to merge forum threads between some runs...).

10881,"Thank you for a highly challenging, interesting and varied course. I have learned a lot which will be helpful for my work, but also personal interest in this area. I did have difficulty sometimes understanding what was said in the lectures (technical issues) and also I thought some of the quiz questions were not correct. They seemed to contradict what was said in the lectures. Otherwise, it was an excellent course and one I would recommend.",4

25229,"Hello,Thank you for this well structured course. Exercises and tutorials are very useful to complement lectures and help increase our skills in the domain.Tools deployment and connection (Oracle database on Virtual box and pentaho data integration) was a nightmare.It would be great if you package all the tools needed for a given course into a predefined virtual machine image ready to be downloaded from the course.Kind Regards,Mouhammad Moustafa",4

It both further my reading and knowledge in some areas, while introducing new topics to me that I'd not yet encountered.My only problem was with the final assignment - it does not do justice to the topic of the final week, which is the issue of colour on ancient monuments (in particular the arch, of course) and the implications of colour on composition and on later perceptions of antiquity.

104264,"I had good assignments, but less content than I expected.",4
50130,well explained. It would be more good if an entirely new worksheet is given for work at the end of course,4
45183,I would recommend everyone of my friends to take this course - irrespective of whether or not they want to learn a specific academic subject. It would be nice if school courses first teach this course as part of curriculum - which surely helps students to to know how to approach the different topics that they want to learn.,4
22569,Good course with practice in Excel,4
50194,"Excellent panorama of classical music.I specially like the lesson about Mozart and the ""Dark side of Mozart"", and what was said about the social evolution of the musicians.",4

95530,THANK YOU!,4
20689,This is a very good and very basic course of epidemiology.,4
31175,An excellent course by a fine teacher. The fifth star is dropped because graded quizzes are not available unless the certificate is purchased - unlike most Coursera courses in which I am interested.,4
89966,Too theoretical. I hope other parts will have more details.,4
79985,"its have a lot of very useful information including the bonus videos, but the way we are examined could be more challenging and the discussion forum would have been very interesting",4
41634,"At the beginning is quiet simple.. But if you miss something, and I'll be honest, in the forum you don't get so much help, you'll need to wait to the Instructor to reply you because he is the only who can put the ""answer"" or at least, the help you need.Aside this... This course is great! it teaches you every thing you need to know (at least the basics) for start programming in C#",4
7827,Useful and helpful strategies and information about nutritional cooking.,4
20086,simply and easily to understand.,4
67574,Great course like the others,4

17306,Very usefull course. Great!,4
29752,"I enjoyed this course; although, I only participated in the free version.",4
87648,"Assignments were too easy, and were really ""fed"" to us. Also, I liked better the setting in the previous course where Dr. Chuck was in his office and we always saw his screen.",4
98559,"it was a lot of work and there were some errors and issues, esp. trouble with peer review. the professor was dynamic and encouraging. content and most activities were very helpful.",4
38959,Great course for beginners! Had expected to get a little understanding of an object oriented approach to JavaScript from the projects in the course. Hopefully there would be some other upcoming course with a higher difficulty level meeting my expectations!,4
55623,A comprehensive introduction to machine learning.,4
99169,Great introductory level course for undergraduates.More emphasis on commercial application with basic phenomenon of fluid flow and structural mechanics given in the course which could have been upgraded to 2 weeks more of special lectures.Overall a nice experience in solving problems and undertaking tricky scenarios in assignments.,4
65531,Great to learn the basis of the fashion world! I knew nothing and now I know something! Worth the small price to get the certificate!,4
37255,i have great learning form this course and i love to learn more and more form Coursera,4
68353,Very informative and make the machine learning experience much easier for a beginner to all these new concepts. This course is very well set up to help students into the future apply there new knowledge. Only thing is the software was a little difficult to at first get working on my mac but other than that everything was fabulous.,4
67328,"Although I still don't know how do I apply these into my work directly, I have to say it is a quite interesting class.",4
19491,"Good course, could have provided more examples and more elaboration regarding the fourier transform. Good instructor who is knowledgeable about this field. Might be better to introduce tutorials that go through selected problems step by step. Thanks very much and all the best.",4
82627,"To me every mooc by Martin Odersky is pure gold. I guess this course underwent a couple of ""refactorings"" because I didn't have the impression that the topics (and sometimes the assignments) throughout the 4 weeks followed a clear path. This is just my impression though, I might be wrong. Anyway great mooc and lots of fun, I can totally recommend it!",4
4751,Great introduction to the field of astrobiology. Captivating and very interesting - only problem is that it is too short. I would love to learn more !,4
51112,nice course....I am waiting for advance course.,4
95305,Requires most projects to be completed without the videos help. Need to research and find answers elsewhere. Also need to have good sense of python.,4
100435,It is Great. Thank you!,4
29190,"Great insight into the research done at Duke and around the world. Could use more focus on raw data and experimental designs although what was presented seemed fair for a course trying to reach a broad audience, including non scientists.",4
43190,It opened my m,4
30715,Excellent course to refresh the English Grammar and its Punctuation. An overview to students who want to understand the fundamentals of the English Language and utilize the content as a reference for upcoming studies.,4
28157,"An excellent introduction to graphic design. The videos were useful to clearly show the concepts. There were a number of assignments, many of them optional, which allowed you to practice and integrate the learnings. All material was taught at a level that made it accessible to a true novice.My only hesitation on giving this course 5 stars was the lack of any presence of teachers/tutors in the course discussions. There was a lot of questions about the final marked assignment, with many posts on the discussion boards. There was no response from anyone other than the participants in the course. The issue was not clarified and students were left to interpret (and peer review based on that intrepretation) the instructions on their own.",4
26209,The quizzes are too short,4
87468,Assignments were a bit difficult to be completed with the material explained during the lectures.,4
27446,"A perfect introduction to game theory, especially the exercises make you think about the subject.",4
33223,"The course was presented at a decent pace. I would like to see more live coding though. Thanks, learning from you was enjoyable.",4
4409,"I found this course to be very challenging, but I am grateful for the knowledge and the new perspective. Thanks!",4
106074,I thoroughly enjoyed the course as it helped put a lot of learning (that I have had on the job) in proper perspective. I specifically enjoyed the off platform activities.,4
92031,Very informative. Need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning,4
49091,I like that don´t use the romanization. THis was a great course.,4
5894,"Once they dig into the material, the difficulty ramps up, and it's absolutely worth it!",4
25420,"This is a great course with tons of valuable info. The peer-review projects are very hands-on, and you learn a lot by doing that. However, I wish there were more explanations for certain things (for example, for the experiments section) - or at least, more resources to get further info. Also, for Assignment 3, it would have been very helpful to have the answer key, since there is some confusion around some of the answers.",4
37706,Good course to teach you the basics :),4
38700,Quite basic and clear for JAVA beginners,4
77625,First part - relatively easy but escalates quickly,4
30787,Very usefull,4
68539,"Really good theoretical introduction but couldn't do some of the tasks because my python skills weren't up to scratch, however the course says you don't need any previous python knowledge, so I disagree with that. However, overall a really good introduction.",4
95998,good concepts,4
89692,"Perfect, really what I was looking for. Entering the photography world with a critic Eye and knowledge of what you are looking when you are looking a picture.",4
79381,"This course was a fairly decent introduction to personal branding. It certainly made me aware of it, although, it did not completely prepare me for the enormous task of consistent branding. It was a good place to start if you know nothing about things like twitter which I didn't.",4
65287,"It was pretty interesting, although it may be fast at times. I find it particular engaging and interesting. I would definitely continue with the next course.",4
92230,I'd expected it to be more difficult.,4
98241,"I found this was a well-organized fundamental course, despite my slight disappointment that I wanted to gain more knowledge and concepts on some other analysis methods. If you look for analytics course that focuses more on tool or skill, this is not the one.",4
20260,"A good course! The assignments were fun to write. Some videos were redundant, but overall I enjoyed it greatly.",4
16755,"The course was very well presented and was easy to follow. my only problem is that I struggled a little and as much as I was trying to follow and read the recommended reading material, I found that there was not enough time due to the volume of assignments per week. Maybe if the assignments were reduced or we have them every 2 weeks?!",4
49712,I totally recommed this. Prof. Ian explains each and every concept very well.,4
101399,This course has a great over view of these subjects. I the course as a refresher as well as additional insight into regression topics. I liked the course and I would advise this to somebody else as well.,4
42961,good course,4
37481,Good overview of HTML/CSS/Javascript. Nice audio/video quality and preparation. Fun homework assignments and examples.Would have liked more CSS touches.,4
66283,Highly recommand it to do it if you love Canada and its Mountains!,4
35610,"One of the most interesting courses of the specialization. Unfortunately, delivery is still in need of improvement. At least there was some good discussion around the slides, and not all slides were read verbatim. Interesting project at the end!",4
70952,The course content is very good but the professor is not charismatic and in overall it is not well produced as other courses i´ve taken,4
90874,"I loved the course, it was way beyond my expectations. Everything well explained. I only have on critic. I think the assignment of 5 waypoints trajectory was not in accordance with the rest of the course. Imagine the tests following a level line and abruptly changes to something too hard. I think the purpose here is to learn and not find out people with special skills. Many of our colleagues that were following the course simple gave up due to this assignment. And also took 25 hours average for many of us, that not dispose of this time, since the proposed time to complete the tasks are of three hours.",4
89148,It was good and I learned a lot!,4
54242,A very good course to get hands-on experience of various machine learning techniques.,4
40643,Good informative course. The course should cover a little bit of Change Management Concept. Well designed and planned.,4
48474,This course is a great introduction to programming in Python. The practice problems are especially helpful and the final project is a lot of fun!,4
90520,Overall I found this course useful. My only complaint is that the material needed to complete the first assignment in week 1 came in week 2.,4
32031,"Very good content, but technical issues (poor closed captioning, ambiguous question on the exams, a couple of readings that were a little esoteric for an introductory course) led me to mark the course down a star.",4
80025,Great Course...Advise it for new people in project management world. Exercises could be better (putting scenarios or simulators...etc),4
16540,"Very good course, clear lecture.",4
21474,good introduction to digital photography with some good tips. some chapters are a bit too long in my opinion.,4
99985,"The profess just defined several core concept and understand about how to work more efficient. As a engineer with 2 years working experience, this course reminds me several critical concepts need to be practiced but sometimes be neglected in daily work.",4
106984,"Very good course and Prof specialy guest Prof ,now really i have a tools to write story for children and teenager(my dream) ,i hope that i will succeed in my new experience.Thanks for all.",4
81005,A really nice course. I would have wanted more about polymers.,4
22644,"I found this course quite mainingful which helps us to have an overview of Finances and Accounting, including lots of example to enhance the understanding.",4
93835,Very comprehensive course to get on track with R!,4
80098,Great course! Great instruction with ability to apply real life situations with examples.,4
27285,Very interesting course. Thanks Professor Larry DeBrock!!,4
92559,"Great Course, I think would be better if has more examples",4
8835,Excellent course for those people that start in the art of writing!,4
37870,very good course but it is kinda fast for new people,4
47731,"Cool, but had lots of trouble watching videos",4
18562,This is a great intro but it's only going to get your feet wet (if not barely humid).,4
6886,"This course is interesting and well presented. The lecturer injects humour as well as a sense of curiosity into the topics. However, I would have liked to see more mathematics and derivation of justifications of theories. Much of the material was presented as mere facts or observations with little attempt to show reasoning which leads to the conclusions.",4
17940,"I enjoyed the course. This course took me waaaay more time than I thought because I struggled with a few issues. First, I wish I'd started by taking the NLP online course before starting the Capstone (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aMYz1tMfPg). There was an issue installing RWeka, RJava and it took me several days to work through the issues. I eventually moved to using quanteda (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quanteda/vignettes/quickstart.html). I also waited far too long to develop a method to test my model using a subset of the training data, so I could test whether changes to my model improved and reduced performance. It turns out that my model trained on a 25% sample performed just as well as a model trained on 100%. I'm thankful for the Discussion Forum and final peer review process. Both helped me learn how I can improve my model and demo application. I really appreciate the instructors for creating this specialization. I've learned a lot.",4
105461,Good information. Good discussion forum. Recommended.,4
29603,"Great course, I learnt a lot of writing and improve my skills.",4
54430,Very good course and handson experience for non experts. Thanks.,4
106428,The additional links and research material were really interesting and insightful.,4
9769,C,4
40338,Clear easy overview with great archival video,4
62836,Its a very good way to introduce to R language,4
17566,Very useful introductory course to help you get familar with different fields in data science and typical data analysis procedures,4
105035,The only thing that this course needs is more consistency/clarity using the constant with regards to state variables.,4
39116,Very good explanations ! I wish I learned with this class when I learned JS for the first time !,4
82832,"Very interesting, specially in evaluating how necessary the complexity in music is for composers.",4
100042,I think it is so useful for everyone who need to improve there productivity,4
80852,"It is a quite well structured course. Is missing a little bit ""flash"" to become more incentive, attractive. Negotiation is part of ""sell and buy"" something and many times is not only a scheme of calculus, could be also sentimental decision and in this case is difficult to determine the right value (value creation is like a bubble soap, nice but easy to break).",4
23398,"I strongly recommend. If you don't have any knowledge about food - this course is for you. However, if you know some basic stuff you won't learn anything new, but still it is good reminder and very strucured. It is very short, could be completed in about an hour and a half. What I didn't like during the lectures - Maya (the lector) was not talking with her normal voice, but kind of slow and unnatural, which for me was extremely anoying. At the end, when she is showing some recepies it is so much better.",4
80850,Valuable and not too time consuming.,4
101023,"Great course! For a know-nothing person like myself, this course has given me an opportunity to understand one of the most interesting and detailed-oriented subjects to learn. Definitely recommend!",4
4452,"I believe pivot tables also plays a big part in Excel, wish they could incorporate that too.",4
91651,Really straight forward content and great overview of SQL + SQLite. Nice python demos. Sometimes the instructor wanders a bit before he gets to his point.,4
16991,"The course content is very valuable to any digital marketing practitioner, but the reason I am rating it as 4/5 is that there was basically no ""In practice"" part. All assignments were along the lines of ""discuss this,"" which might be OK to make us think, but analytics is so much about doing I missed having a chunk of data thrown at me to see what I can find.",4
49930,"More tooled for High Schoolers, or those just entering into college. Very good course none the less.",4
1725,Needs more comprehensive assignments and challenging quizzes. Other than that the material is excellent!,4
8106,"This course was a great refresher for basic nutritional/health information, and comes with a really great message: don't worry if you're not a great ""chef"", basically any home-cooked meal will be healthier than fast or processed food! I enjoyed the cooking demonstrations and simple solutions for making healthy choices.",4
68047,"Very good introduction to machine learning. Concepts are well presented and explained, i would have preferred to use a Open Source library in the assignments, but is not bad to know how to use Graphlab, a very powerful tool, for sure!",4
24927,It was really nice - I found the last week lectures most valuable.,4
18056,Again the explanation and representation was good.3.5-4 stars for some Data Structures and their performance. Few basic ideas and introduction about the gui of the project would make it 5stars.,4
403,"While I did not have time to complete the final assignment I did find this course useful for creating a firmer understanding of Ableton Live. The peer review process is a great idea and something which I found to be both engaging and useful for networking with fellow artists.The content of the course I feel is probably useful to someone with no prior knowledge of DAWs, but this is not my first DAW. As such the course felt a little slow and the assignments a little unchallenging. Personally my peer review experience ranged from listening to fully fleshed out ideas to listening to uninspired loops of nonsense. I still feel as though I benefited from the process, however, and I gained an invaluable resource in Blend.I would love a next level - fleshing out some of the ideas touched on throughout the course, as well as exploring other ideas such as sidechaining.",4
63649,good and very nice,4
30775,"It is great so far and the way it is outlined, I hope that I get what I need from it.",4
105378,The materials are good. The forum is less active.,4
93517,"Great course to start getting your hands into R. While the lectures are OK and the Swirl exercises are great, the course falls a bit short in building you up to tackling the weekly programming assignments. I had to spend a lot of time researching on my own to complete the assignments. I don't mind that, but I could do that on my own without paying for the course. I'm paying because I want to learn R quickly without spending hours researching what could have easily been described in the lectures. A lot of times, the course mentors in the discussion forums provided the best guidance. I would have liked each programming exercise to build upon the last one, so that at the end of the course I would have a great R product to review later. As it is, each programming assignment can stand on its own. When learning to programming in a new language, I prefer small, quick victories that build upon one another to accomplish a great task. This is the reason for not giving full 5-stars. Otherwise, Dr. Peng does a good job at providing material. And, be sure to check out his podcast, Not So Standard Deviations, to remind you that even people who have been in this field for years still find some areas challenging. It gives us R beginners some mental support.",4
53196,Excellent High level overview of Machine learning topics.,4
10153,"The course gave me an interesting overview of different problems from the cloud computing field. The course start looks little bit slow, but later it gets more interesting. However I was disappointed with code quality of the assignment framework.",4
38644,It could done better,4
31944,Very good class though at times it could be hard to hear some of the audio lessons,4
57272,"Very accessible course, with a wide variety of topics. It provides a good introduction to ML. The pacing of the course is good, and somewhat faster than e.g. WU's machine learning specialization (where linear regression and classification take up an entire module, instead of one lecture). In that sense, this course may be a particularly good fit for people that already have some working knowledge of statistics and (statistical) programming. Also, Andrew Ng is a very good and inspiring professor.In the programming exercises, there is a lot of emphasis on vectorization, which is very useful. However, once you've wrapped your head around that concept, many of them sometimes seem a little too straightforward to implement. Nonetheless, the applications are very cool, including e.g. computer vision and anomaly detection. The (free) software (Octave) is very intuitive and easy to use.All in all, an excellent course. If only there was an ""intermediate ML"" follow up by professor Ng.",4
65441,That was a great experience to join this course. I work in the luxury retail and it helps me to have a clear vision of the current and future challenges in this business. I would like to go deeper in each subjects in applying later to a luxury and fashion management MBA.,4
88365,Good content as long as you have some familiarity with programing and computer configuration.,4
82628,"Excellent course, has a good transition from the previous course but still manages to be standalone. The last week about reactive programming was a little hamfisted, though. I would have liked a more formal, but pragmatic, approach like Martin usually does.",4
71861,Great insight for those who are keen in pursuing supply chain management,4
106277,Very good course thank youI wish we could have use case applications with high level tools such as RThanks a lot again !,4
82014,"Good course on the basics and very helpful for just starting out. Foesn't teach too much programming theory, so for those who already know how to program, it's all you need to understand simple web development.",4
16698,Step by step explanations. Divided into small parts so that the students can digest the information in small pieces. I like it so far.,4
17771,Very good introduction to the topic and also clarifies some terms that are in the air and end up misleading. like inference prediction and machine learning.,4
15191,A good course for identifying the field of data science and introducing the computing tools of the trade.,4
93830,I think the video is much easier than the quizzes and assignments. There is a big gap between the weekly video and the quizzes.,4
39689,"I strongly recommend this course, it is very well explained. very engaging.",4
11636,I enjoyed this course. It was great as a review of C++ and an introduction to C++11 for me. The assignments are heavy in graph theory and are non-trivial.,4
95976,there's a lot to learn.,4
64491,"The teacher is awesome and I understood the concepts that I had never paid attention to in college! Thanks a lot for this course.Suggestion: Maybe a bit mode detailed explanation regarding the congestion control mechanism of TCP(CWR, ECN), and how it works in real life.",4
67918,"The course is good, the Lecturer is great. I learned a lot in this course.",4
75888,"Good introductory course. I enjoyed learning the basics of the Python computer language. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because the class information was not presented 100% clearly. It was not very clear where to access the book, or what readings corresponded to which lectures. Otherwise a great class.",4
5077,The course was great! It was quite dense and took a lot of time especially the R Lab sessions. Mr Loon may like to use more interesting ways for communication. Also the transcripts provided do not contain equations/ formulas which becomes a problem. Integrating slides into transcripts would be helpful.,4
90893,"TAs should have been more available/active in discussions (especially given the scale of the last assignment), otherwise enjoyable/challenging course",4
28860,Very interesting!!!!,4
10125,"Great course! I learnt basics of current cloud computing technologies, even this is really tough course.",4
39079,"I think this course does a pretty good of introducing JavaScript. It covers the essentials of how to create functions and implement event handlers that react to the users, which is the most common use of JS. As an introductory course, it correctly assumes some of its audience has no prior programming background. However, it is difficult to teach programming in such a short time. As an experienced programmer, I would recommend reviewing the order in which some of the concepts are presented to try to help in this aspect.I was personally hoping that the final assignment would be a bit more challenging, but it was very straightforward. Form handling (the topic in the final week) is certainly where I've used JS the most during my career, so I was glad that it was given special attention.Again, this is a really good course for beginners; Dr. Van Lent is awesome.",4
24651,Clear simple language well presented. Keeps audience interested.,4
83647,"All the course is good, the online playground may need to be upgraded so that we can see the invisible tab and space to code efficiently.",4
66894,Challenging course for economists,4
8653,very good course and explains deeply yet clearly the biology of cancer,4
9140,"This course is awesome. To listen to professor Jim Fowler break down seemingly hard concepts into easy-to-understand chunks is hugely satisfying. But make no mistake. The course is not easy. But if you put in the effort, you will find it very fulfilling.The last three sections (weeks 14, 15, and 16) are probably the best parts of the course. It’s thrilling to experience professor Fowler solve hairy integration problems with u substitution and integration by parts.The grading section is a little buggy and may cause frustration for learners. But overall, you can work around the bugs if you take the time to review the bug list in the discussion forums.The mentors are fantastic and provide quick responses to your questions on the forums.",4
48582,my first course in couresra. the effort for designing the course is much appreciated!,4
12557,"Although some matters are presented quite broadly and generically, some others are exhaustive and of practical usage, especially the ones supported by documents and references: very useful!",4
16026,This course is really informative and provides new learning to me. It is just what i need in my career path right now. Kudos to the developer of this course and for making it available on the internet platform,4
69391,"Introduction to basic vocabulary and grammar. I give it 4 stars because it does not discuss any characters, just uses pinyin.",4
12225,I enjoyed this course. I used it for personal development. It gave great tools and information to think about as a middle manager and how to properly communicate with,4
94792,Very clear explanations and right to the point.,4
32214,It'so interesting and helpful!!!,4
102320,"This course was encouraging and well structured. Thanks a lot!!One less star, because the way lecture has been delivered could have been more conversational instead of one way. Like the way Udacity delivers.Plz don't mind :P",4
42935,The tests are a little too easy.,4
80722,Great content!,4
30485,Very simple and helpful. Just the perfect mix for me.,4
75375,Good introductory course,4
42627,"Before starting to learn everything, suggests to take this course first to ensure how we can learn better.",4
80537,"I thank Professor George Siedal and Coursera for the course. It was useful and enjoyable experience while doing this course. I joined this course to learn regarding negotiations but I also ended up learning about contracts,mediation and arbitration.",4
76227,"Good Course for beginners,although students with little coding experience will find this course a little slow.",4
61896,"A very enjoyable introduction to proofs, number theory, and some real analysis.",4
10606,"A very informative ,interesting journey through the world of chemistry",4
45398,Very simple and basic,4
18509,"interesting programming topics selected. Modifying image is something that everyone could relate to as everyone must have encountered with digital image before.The use of pencode which is WYSIWYG editor makes it more interactive and current. A huge improvement from the plain, boring Python platform and text editor.Most of the instructors facial expression are so dead, and flat-voice delivery makes it a chore to watch. Think how youtube tutorials engage their audience and makes it entertaining to watch. But maybe that's too much to ask for a traditional institutional lecture.Overall, this is one of the best intro to programming video I have watched. The lessons choice are relevant and could be followed with ease.",4
63779,the course is great but this is a little work as colleen says our hands didn't get dirty a lot but i really like it a lot,4
98362,I think whole course was well explained but sometimes I had a hard time to get a key point in videos.,4
1685,Excellent course to get an insight of Data related tasks and profession,4
89466,"I really enjoyed this course overall (and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already), but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments. It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors/teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues, especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people. But, I enjoyed the illustrations (drawings) and cute examples, and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera. I would probably give this course a 4.5 if possible, but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues. Anyway I would recommend the course to someone who wants a survey of quantitative methods to prepare for future study.",4
15564,Meetings is one of the most useful courses for all professionals.,4
37217,"A great class for anyone interested in learning the essentials of html, css, and javascript in relatively short order.",4
18923,Assignments should have been mentioned in details.,4
82838,"Quite an interesting course connecting various fields such as mathematics, physics, brain science, music and music theory. I am giving it 4 stars as I feel that some explanations are weak and need more elaboration.",4
73024,I'm hooked on typography now. I've read a number of the books that were recommended. Instructor was interesting and the material was engaging. Would recommend.,4

24437,A very interested course. Only suggestion:a. if possibile more interation with the professorsb. being more realistic in the case studies,4
103723,although the teacher must be using android phone but it does not influence its a nice lecture,4
48404,"The cpurse is for someone who eants pure programing, in my case i want python for predictive procedures.",4
1027,Good learning,4
10986,Very interesting but perhaps not as in-depth as I would have ideally liked. That being said I learned quite a lot and would encourages others to undertake this course of study as well.,4
1996,"This entry-level course provides a general understanding of data related job positions, companies, and industries. The difficulty of the course is suitable for those new to the data world.",4
89958,I love the course's content but discussions are of poor quality and the honors tracks assignments are a little messy. I ought having more explanation about the tool to use or maybe doing the programming assignments in another tool/language than Lenskit even it seems like a decent project.,4
54730,"great lectures, thanks andrew. i particularly liked you silicon valley insights! sometimes the exercises were so tough, that even I with a phd in econometrics struggled... the risk is to loose a lot of time on matlab syntax... but we had great support by tom...",4
42340,Great and timely course. I really enjoyed it and looking forward to the Capstone.,4
40501,very good course!,4
27531,"The content of the course is very interesting. The final task could be more ambitious, however - just to inspire greatness.",4
12028,"As an introduction to cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular the lectures were top quality, and I returned a number of times to watch certain parts again. Thank you for well prepared lectures and material. The java exercises I found a bit laborous and not exactly matching with the content of the lectures; for someone with a lot of experience in java probably easier, but as I saw in the forum discussions, many java programmers had difficulty finding their way to the solution as well.",4
4683,Great course on a fascinating area of science. The presentation could have been a bit more engaging with some animations though.,4
51008,I really like the information,4
102853,Excellent course. It makes you analyze yourself own thoughts and ideas about violence.,4
11437,"have learn too much interesting concepts and perspective regarding interpreting the results of an statistical analysis, also knowing how to chose the perfect statistic tool for a given data set>>>>really enjoyed to have such course with that excellent explanationNote:can you guys make a better presentation image to visualize hard concepts.",4
90236,"very informative course, covers several aspects of questionnaires. Many examples are provided although references are a bit old but i suppose that they are seminal research works.",4
92910,"A challenge for the beginner, lots is covered, little is explained about the completion of the projects. An excelent challenge for the investigative minded. Highly recommended, but not for the unitiated without conviction or the faint of heart.",4
5087,This course covers the basic knowledge of statistics and probability but skips the mathematical details behind the theory. Great for beginners but not perfect for advanced users.,4
55148,This course is helpful for the one who are new in this field,4
91977,Great course!,4
36802,"It is basic, but helpful. If you have an intermediate english and you don´t use it much in your job, you can catch up you english practice with many business terms.It also gives some basic but good tips for developing in a team and as a leader.",4
86823,"I found that some parts of the course were confusing. You really have to take the time to read documentation to do the assignments, which was difficult with my busy schedule. (And just because you read the documentation doesn't mean that you understand the code!) Overall, I learned a lot and still recommend the course - just wish there was less background and more explanation of the actual codes that you can use while parsing.",4
33633,It is a great course and the instructor has such a great way to teach that it's very easy to understand the content. Theres is only one thing left... more excercises.,4

73537,Very informative and very well explained for beginners,4
6172,"Very nice overview, but it seemed to be too much information for the limited time. There should be a separate six week course for each threshold.",4
30751,"Before I started this course, I used to do a lot of guess work while editing my essays. I relied on proofreading program to get review my essays. This course has helped me understand crucial parts of sentences; thereby, enabling me with greater confidence to edit my essays.Although this course is intended for beginners, it would certainly help experienced hands refresh their skills. Try it!",4
106272,The content is really good but the course has too much theory. Mixing it with some practical programming assignments would have been very nice,4
67617,This is a really nice course! I am fortunate to be part of it!,4
18130,"The lectures, assignments, and projects all encourage you to learn about how to design and use optimal search algorithms for text-based applications. I especially value how the discussions present the material in way that is relatively easy to see how it relates to search routines in general. My only complaint is that the instructions do not inform you about the constraints that the online grader implicitly imposes on you. This unfortunately meant that I was not able to submit code with further optimizations that I came up with.",4
94204,Very useful course to develop level knowledge in machine learning.,4
67015,"Interesting. Good for beginners but some info is a little bit out of date. Overall, good course.",4
14021,This is a good overview of the Data Science track.,4
1093,Very Interesting course that covers a huge range of topics over a long period of time. A very well informed lecturer who can speak about the subject matter in a clear and concise manner.,4
32080,"Sometimes it was hard to understand the concept the professor was trying to make, because some grammatical forms were wrong and therefore the whole concept misleading. Otherwise very interesting course and thank you!",4
2602,Quite helpful,4
90252,Good Course. To the point and clean lectures.,4

73955,"It's a good course, but sometimes I hava problems with web-bags (my information - actions) were unavailable or didn't update",4
95963,A very informative course. You don't need to have any previous knowledge on the subject to understand the terms.,4
98461,"Excelent course to start with the basics of R language. It gives a modern introduction to R programming avoiding traditional topics like loops and conditionals keeping them for more advanced programming topics. It also covers almost all tidyverse packages with a shallow introduction to the most common packages.I have acomplaint. The dataset for the final quiz was outdated, I managed to pass the quiz guessing variable names.",4
44245,I like how the course was supplied with anecdotes because it makes it easier to apply the lesson. Please make the interviews more organized.,4
80302,"This course was tremendously helpful for someone who, like myself, may have a background in planning but was never taught a formal approach to it. It really was a pleasant surprise to find this course.",4
5020,"really interesting, it's a really good base for all to understand the Arctic and a rebound to understand the climat change. I would like to learn more in the pdf lesson, if you'll be able to add some optional lessons to read I would appreciate, but for sur I'll take the next course. It well structure and explain. The other thing is about the test it will be interesting to have all the good answer after we've pass it. Just to understand our mistake",4
28135,Great introduction of the fundementals of graphic design! I recommend it - the videos and instructor are clear and concise. I look forward to the next course in the specialization.,4
59930,Fun course to take. Sometimes a little bit overexplaining obvious things (due to this it's often convenient to watch videos with 1.5x-2.0x speeds) and hiding quite a great amount of math. Even though it doesn't fulfill all my requirements and demands (that is explaining the nature of method/algorithm and it's derivation) I definitely can understand teacher's focusing on the practical side of the subject.,4
29810,"Leaning from thesis sentence, supporting ideas and topic .",4
4480,Good but the final project could have been setup up with better instructions.,4
21215,Hopefully it could be clearer on dimension reduction.,4
15035,Great course!!!!,4
23525,It is so useful.Especially the professor will teach you how to cook and I felt so hunger when I was watching.,4
27805,I learned some stuff and this was one of the easier courses I have taken.,4
18018,"At the start of Week 1, the course was a bit boring (too slow, too easy), but things were becoming more and more interesting: We were able to see many up-to-date technologies used in companies, several protocols, market tendencies, many competitors/actors,I recommend to students to open an account at AWS, Azure, GoogleCompute and create their own exercises (it is mostly free for limited usage).",4
16748,"The lecture videos have a format that is a bit over structured. It feels like the instructor takes as much time asking and answering an often contrived ""motivation"" question as he does teaching relevant material. The slides are of sufficient quality however to make viewing the lectures optional. .I would have appreciated having all the courses documents in single zip file.",4
102838,"The transcripts are not actually same, so its difficult sometimes to get what speaker is saying as accent is hard to understand.Content is good but its not depth for engineering students",4
45223,"Very interesting course, with lots of very good tips and useful advice on how to improve learning, and also how to understand what is happening when learning a new thing. Its tips on procrastination are certain to help you make the most of your day.",4
34404,a few mistakes during the course,4
93219,A lot of programing!!,4
21919,"Good course, learned a lot especially through the quizzes and the course project, but slides/presentations could be more engaging.",4
31126,This is an excellent course to review your grammar and punctuation.,4
18896,"Very good assignments, honors track.",4
34909,"Great course, right what I needed as I use with statistics and econometrics in development issues, but I needed to add the ""spatial"" element.I would give the 5th star, if the slide of the lessons were availablethanks!",4
32974,It's really nice of you all that giving everybody the opportunity to learn this course. Thank you very much and keep up your good work.,4
95322,"Great course for data preparation for ML which is sometimes neglected in other courses. Great instructor. Useful assignments. Assignments require research on your own which is good. I would recommend to maybe make the course longer and cover more topics (in-depth string processing etc.), because it felt a bit short. Thanks Dr. Brooks for putting this together.",4
30762,"I have learned a lot with this course! It's like you are really attending a class, and socializing everyday with your classmates. I really had fun. Thank you!",4
94487,Great course.,4
81229,Very Good course for beginners in Economics. Very well explained principles using real-life examples and history as well. One thing I might suggest is maybe update the course regularly so that some of the things you say about developing nations are consistent with what is actually being observed today. I'm from Kenya as it is and I found some of the material very media-sensitized for developed nations.,4
62943,I would like to have an opportunity to contact my reviews.,4
33053,Good introduction,4
22078,I have really appreciated this course.,4
106683,Good course but would have loved two things : more practical examples and certainly more detailed info on multiples.,4
34210,Learned plenty about the foundations of entrepreneurship.,4
2262,Very useful and handy tips.,4
63294,In general it was an interesting and thought-provoking course. The only minus was that we weren't able to download a pdf version of a book to which the professor kept referring. Recommend for anyone who wants to get to know the basics of economy.,4
1183,"I knew nothing about ancient Greece before. Excellent course. Thanks. David Pearsall, Greenville NC",4
106001,The English translation into simple Chinese is not very good. I missed the meaning of words or sentences from simple Chinese.,4
73286,"The contents of the course were relevant and highlighted some real issues and considerations to have in mind, but quizzes were a bit ambiguous and there were some issues in there.",4
103972,Hope next courses will be more detailed.It is hard to understand some things without experience.,4
19031,"The course could be structured a little bit better and some topics should have been discussed in greater detail. But in general, I really enjoyed the course and found the two instructors very likable.",4
46221,"Very interesting to know more about learning. Very simple and down to earth, don't expect a Master Degree level type of course. But good course for everybody curious and willing to improve their learning skills.",4
75686,good one to start with,4
91107,I havent received my certificate for completing this course why ?,4
15828,"This is definitely a great course. Prof. Estrada explained the basic concepts very well. Extremely useful for someone who doesn't have a financial background like me. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that I wished the quizzes were a little more tricky that would help test my understanding of the materials. Overall, pretty good, thanks Coursera and Prof. Estrada for the course!!",4
106362,I'd like to be able to take a free version of the quizzes.,4
79435,Very good course but some of the videos were buffering and I couldn't view them properly.,4
65406,It's very easy to understand for the researchers who don't have much knowledge of BIo,4
65863,The lessons i have learned through the course have taught me to new perspective to the time period. Great study.Thank you,4
27332,this is a useful course,4
25425,Everything is great apart of the third week assignment. I guess it needs to be changed.,4
90484,Good but not that deep. This should be in 2 weeks.,4
94812,5/5 if there were more pictures and diagrams of the methods while they were talking to better visualize.,4
19747,"Good course, but be aware of the 101 part. One of the minuses is that a lot of information provided in the course is about US (to be honest i expected more world related data) and the professor is not that emotional / interesting (sometimes monotoneous).",4
69479,"Really good course. But you need to study hard, because not everything is written on the board.",4
105367,This course is the best for people who are interested in pursuing or continuing their tertiary education in Japan. I highly recommend to people who suited above seek to join this course as the course will give you a better understanding on Japanese university structure.,4
38704,"The content of the curse was brilliant, fascinating and very interesting. However, the instructions for doing the assignments were sometimes not entirely clear or even conflicting (as in the first week assignment, where in the overview page it was said that you should do a video with you AND another person and the submission page said it was a video with you OR another person). There also seemed to be no instructor around to clarify this issues or help with questions or problems the classmates had. Still, a great course that I would recommend anyone interested in education, teaching and learning to do, with a lot of amazing references and material, and given by a school that is really worried about their students learning and want their voices to be heard :)",4
19169,Very interesting and entertaining!,4
53136,"The course was very well presented. The only bother is the peer review can take quite a long time and I had completed the course well in advance of having ""officially"" finished.",4
21495,"Good:very wide and also deep in transferring knowedgeassignments are clear and challenging because they require a story to which the shots ghave to followNot so good:sometimes the shown examples are show too shortly, and the videos toggle between professor and motiv to fast. Show both at the same time woiuld helpthe (iOs) app is a bit limited (e.g. assessments can not be edited).",4
88844,Great introduction to Philosophy! I think the last couple of weeks could've been done a bit better as they're quite niche forms of philosophy but other than that it's great.,4
76287,"It's very basic, suitable for beginners.",4
64983,"Nice and rather short course, giving a good introduction about Ancient Egypt.",4
13160,Excellent perspective of competitive strategy in general. The lecturer was very articulate and gave insightful anecdotes to all the concepts being taught. Very good for developing business thinking on the fly with all the different considerations. Suggestion would be to create a end of course case project.,4
75872,Well thought out sequencing of covered topics. Decent incorporation of learned capabilities in subsequent exercises.,4
41827,Great introduction into digital marketing.,4
3630,"At first the course is hands on, later on it becomes more of theory. This would have been a challenging course if we had more harder graph problems to solve though.",4
63455,This is an important course for your own personal development. Personal and professional challenges have to be dealt with effectively and rationally . Take this course and enjoy new ideas and techniques for developing yourself.,4
6062,"Very nice course, only minor issue is that the assignments were a tad easy",4
31130,The course was short and to the point which helped me understanding the use of punctuations specially Comma and semi colon and different types of sentence structures and variety.,4
2430,Well designed course. I have a couple of close family members who are addicts...pills and gambling. I highly recommend this class. The professor is excellent and I've benefited from his lectures.,4
78359,Very useful course to begin with python.,4
67880,A fair amount of self-study is necessary to learn everything covered in-depth (especially if you haven't yet learned these as part of a formal course).,4
103414,One splendid course ! I thoroughly enjoyed taking it and look forward to the next part of it.,4
41320,relatively easy but still excellent for the beginner!,4
38816,some of the audio is difficult to understand at the firms,4
19102,A nice introduction to the topic. Suitable for a beginner.,4
99874,Good tools for time management,4
38356,This course was really good from the information available and the follow along for the course. The biggest issues I had were that Unity had issues between the different releases for the various platforms. The import of the assets on Windows 10 required some extra lifting that was not covered by the videos. And the teachers were not very present on the message board. Which seems to be an ever-present problem in this Specialization.,4
79345,"A very helpful course, with insights I never thought of.",4
76712,"Simple, easy introductory course. This is just the beginning. You should at least take the next two courses in the Python for Everybody Specialization to learn at least 90% of the language.",4
82305,great course to start learning meteor js,4
13950,"Good course, that brings goos insights on the basics about data science.The lectures about Git and GitHub are not so clear - maybe this classes would better fit when the class already have a more advanced knowldge on the course's theme.Thank you for the quality of the lessons and to make it available.",4
90961,"This is a very interesting course focusing on the legacy of two US presidents and one wife of a president--Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. In particular, I enjoyed the attention given to the contributions of Eleanor Roosevelt during and after her husband's administration.",4
64162,It is only a survey but it is enlightening and helps to understand,4
92240,Course is very good itself but assignments is very easy.,4
8014,"this course is very simple and specific, very important to parentsthanks for all team",4
91738,I enjoyed learning Python with Database,4
77451,for beginners is wary good :),4
2024,Good beginning course.,4
12936,Good but not so deep as I expected.,4
101570,"Very enjoyable course! However, I think that it would have been nice to have some more professional viewing of our work, since several of us were taking in this information for the first time.",4
65385,"Very good intro course. Information is presented clearly and concisely, and it was pretty easy to comprehend even with no background. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the quizzes were a bit too easy and I don't think touch on all the important details.",4
85323,It was a good course - my only issue is that the quiz material is out of order.,4
41457,"Good course, it seemed too easy at times since they provided alot of guides to solving the programming problems but I might be biased since I have some programming background. Overall I would recommend for beginners interested in learning java.",4
85033,"I am satisfied with this course, learned a lot, thanks!",4
4872,"This course is well fitted for clinicians, for scientists, i mean biologists, we can have a relevant matter too.",4
75717,Its simply great!!!!!,4
101046,A really good course. I especially like the practical supplementary lectures on MS Project and Excel. Would be better if the assessments took on more challenging formats than just multiple choice quizzes.,4
48967,"The course was amazing, and fruitful.",4
27473,"Short but complete course about project management, I like.",4
73712,"It is somehow fundamental, but it was useful.",4
29481,"This course has very interesting and complete content. However, for begginers it can be a bit hard to take all quizes successfully at first attempt, due to the high number of concepts addressed in the videos and articles. Some concepts seems obvious at first, but a begginner can get confused among them. Maybe the material should be better organized in topics, in order to facilitate the comprehension of different ideas. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this course.",4
14897,Basic introduction...,4
100790,I like this but there is quite a bit of data and info to cram.,4
88569,"A very basic but thorough introduction to the world of psychological first aid. The class includes a single sample intervention that is referenced at the end of every unit. The actors (including Dr. Everly himself!) seem very well-rehearsed, and this single encounter makes for an excellent template for how to apply the RAPID model in real life!",4
76591,"Very very basic intro course... Great for students new to programming without a C, C++ background",4
7581,"I think this was a great intro course and parents would benefit from it greatly. I wish more of the recipes were vegetarian and diary free (I was in fact surprised that so much diary was part of the recipes). Regardless, a lot better foods than those being served on a regular basis.",4
2464,Really interesting even if a little complex at times,4
15780,This course helped me in my writing. I enjoyed the feedback and the exercises.,4
93344,Good introduction to R,4
63695,Quite nice course. Easy going.,4
41407,use my analytical skills with this course.,4
87770,"Great course, great instructor! I've learned a lot, but the assignments are a little easy.",4
7589,"This goes over basics for how to involve kids, which is great. If you're already a thoughtful cook, it may not have a ton for you as far as recipes go but the information on how we use our nutrients and balancing food is fantastic.",4
13558,"great course but I think the last two modules are a little difficult to understand, especially for beginner like me",4
27391,"Some of the material could have been re-recorded to remove the mistakes, but overall good work.",4
22272,"The class was a little brief, but I really did enjoy the way it was presented. The real life situation, with videos, and a famous company made this hit close to home. I really enjoyed the ""choose your own adventure"" format of it as well. Unfortunately it was so brief, where the $49 price seemed a little high in comparison to the content that was available in the other sources in the Executive Specialization series. I also would have liked a longer or more in-depth scenario. Lastly, for any of the ""wrong choices"" that were chosen, a debrief ""why"" they were wrong would have also helped. Even though there is room for improvement (and thus a 4 star rating and not a 5), I really did enjoy it and found it to be a very enjoyable way to end the series.",4
76204,i am very happy when I completed this course. thank you to Coursera <3,4
93732,Too hard. I needed more programming skills prior to this course,4
1679,really informative for technical engineers who want to know more about business! you can count on that!,4
30049,Good course to have an overview on the global financial markets and instruments.,4
40758,"highly detailed insight, assignment makes it more interactive and thorough",4
7145,A Good course with an informative execution centred curriculum,4
77203,"Some of the coding exercises have mistakes in them. Other than that, a great course for beginners.",4
61288,The exercises included help a lot in practically understanding the matter. I did not find that in other courses and it was a miss.,4
86617,This was a easy to follow introduction to some python libraries used to access web services.,4
33629,Is a good course,4
72628,Great,4
25085,"I think the final project required much more domain knowledge than what the course actually taught.Peer review system can be sometimes very confusing. Some of the confusions can be clarified by reading bunch of past discussions, but it'd be much better if there is a single place (not discussion forum) where students can find all the necessary information regarding the final project and how to grade. I think this info must be part of syllabus.",4
66964,"Pretty informative course. I found some difficulties understanding some of the terms provided in this MOOC; thus, I think having more illustrated presentation would make it easier to follow along. Great efforts and a huge amount of ideas. Thank you so much.",4
65418,it is very good but needs some more explanation and supportive materials other than videos to get more knowledge,4
37610,Good one. Going from Basics to little bit advance. Nice assignments and Quiz added in course.,4
61433,"Very good instructor and good structure and pace to the class. Would have liked more real-life examples, and would have liked peer review questions that required more thought and strategy behind them. ""Which channel do you like more"" isn't really that intriguing a question. Instead, a different question could have been ""How might you leverage each channel for different purposes?""",4
82809,Classical in type and value,4
60512,"It was a great experience a big amount of knowledge in a short presentation. Overall the summary papers are great, however I missed a more interactive videos with more bullets points and etc.Thank you!",4
28049,"A great course to learn to design. It's not a software course, which is perfect. Just what I needed it. Unfortunately, it's too short.",4
61119,Excellent course !! wish it was completely generalisable to all countries not only u.s.,4
96323,"This class teaches you the essentials of Bootstrap v3. It is by no means a complete course on Bootstrap, but it will teach you how to use the main components effectively.",4
85941,"Excellent beginner course as many tasks in life are mini projects...some not so mini... Time-bound, unique deliverables organized in a way to keep all stakeholders informed along the way.",4
42434,"Good, informative and precise. Thank you Prof. Doug Thomas.",4
869,Very good Course!! Thank You.,4
102713,"The second half of lectures were a little confusing, but nothing that a rewatch can´t solve!",4
61861,"I learned quite a lot about plotting, especially in Python. However, there was a bit too much theory (Cairos principles etc) for my taste.",4
92103,Would love to have more challenging assignments,4
14383,I felt I learn some basics but nothing new or indepth,4
28544,It was a nicely designed course. Though I believe it could have been made more compact.,4
70457,"When I signed up for this course I had already taken a year's worth of Java classes and was quite well prepared. My overall opinion of the course is that it was really good and the instructors did a good job by presenting clear videos of some beginning - intermediate level concepts. I especially liked Christine's and Mia's presentations. The videos on memory models were really great and helped me a lot. The assignments were really interesting too as they collected and mapped real time data of earthquakes onto a map, but some of the external libraries being used in UnfoldingMaps could have been explained a little better as to what their implementations were. In the beginning it was a little confusing trying to figure out the superclasses even though the Javadocs for them were available. I also felt that the Interaction Design Lab in Germany - the folks who implemented the UnfoldingMaps could have made the Javadocs of their classes a little more detailed. Further explanation of how to use the classes built into the course would have been very helpful. Hence the 4/5 stars given. But overall I really enjoyed the class and am really looking forward to the second class in the sequence. Well done!",4
88870,"great, perhaps the tests doesn't work very well",4
104275,"i really like the material, i feel that i learning the basic of video game development",4
68464,"Decent intro, though it would be a lot more useful if the professor didn't use his Software and instead thought us implementations using python/R which are used in most commercial applciations",4
63786,"Good intro to Responsive Design, although the homeworks could be harder.",4
105434,I did enjoining this program. Many thanks.,4
89859,good introduction to python,4
17710,Quick and concise. A great deal of knowledge acquired.,4
7785,"I enjoyed this course very much and found it to be a very good introduction to the science of nutrition and cooking. It wasn't focused on children as much as I thought it would be. I would have liked to know a lot more about portion sizes and calories intake, which weren't much discussed. I knew that some foods were good and others were bad... thanks to the course, I now also know why! I didn't find the course too challenging and thought that Maya Adams was a very pleasant instructor.",4
27166,Very good course!Assignments deserve to be longer and more challenging though,4
8444,"The course material is overall very good and easy to understand, although a bit abstract at certain points (mostly when it comes to technical things like what MapReduce consists of and what Programming Models are). Regardless, the instructors do a great job of explaining the concepts. Great course overall",4
87503,"Great course, I would highly recommend it to everyone who want to learn more about XML and JSON and how to use it in Python. The exercises and assignments should be tougher though!",4
70473,"Great introduction to Java. Gives you an opportunity to play with several different libraries from the start, rather than learning the basics with just text input and output like most courses, which is really cool. No peer review, just quiz questions that can only be answered if the assignment is completed correctly. The assignments are therefore not particularly challenging -- you get out of this class what you put in!",4
58170,"Nice beginner level course. Shows the big picture without dwelling much into nitty-gritty. Basic knowledge of Linear Algebra would not hurt but that's not necessary. Needless to say, Prof Andrew's teachings/advices were fabulous during the course. Programming assignments were mostly trivial. They can be made a bit challenging. Thanks.",4
10730,"I really enjoyed this course and I have found a lot of similarities with issues and challenges that I face every day at work. This has been very useful to me bot as a way to get inspired on new ideas and techniques, and as a way to confirm what I am already doing.However, there were few occasions where I found the quizzes not to be clear enough.In some instances this was due to the fact that the question asked required some extra knowledge that couldn't possibly be achieved only by reading the course material or listening to the class. I was lucky I new the answers because of my personal experience but it seemed quite unfair in my opinion. Also lectures materials are very short and don;t provide any extra information.In other cases, the answers, especially when there were multiple answers didn't seem to be clear enough and sometimes contradicting what I had listened in the class. I don't remember specific cases at the moment, however I have left feedbacks throughout the course. You should have my feedbacks where I mentioned specific questions that in my opinion were confusing.Hope this helps,Giacomo",4
65358,"I appreciated how the instructors presented the content in a fluid and limpid manner, with relevant examples and auxillary knowledge that you couldn't find in a textbook. The assignments provided the opportunity to apply the learned content to analyse and parse statistical data from actual journals.The new and up-to-date knowledge I gained by taking this course made me more confident to apply to graduate school.Thank You",4
105135,Gives a simple and clear overview of different business models and their impact on society.,4
11094,Social media IMC and IBM interview was amazing,4
62208,Great learning experience!,4
29140,"The course is nice introduction to the study of dogs behaviour, with easy to follow lectures and exercises, after finishing you understand that dogs are smarter than we think.",4
71754,Good and clear lectureincluding a lot of question during the lecture show,4
99783,Good one,4
6588,"I enjoyed the course, the structure and the material. I really enjoyed the interviews with some of the speakers. Occasionally certain lectures were a little dry for video.",4
93521,Very useful course. R from scratch. Thank you very much.,4
25429,"This class was insanely insightful, and I found many of the topics covered very interesting and fascinating — towards the end of the course, specifically around designing experiments, I found that whole terrain to be pretty difficult to comprehend. I think the lectures have opportunities for improvement here.",4
70956,It was awonderfull learning jeorney,4
91412,Great!,4
51673,Very good content. Very good introduction to advanced topics in embedded systems. I believe this is the first session and the course definitely needs some work to make it more interactive and engaging. Much of it is simply links to articles and then a quiz on what you read. Anyways I recommend it to anyone interested in embedded systems.,4
34045,very interesting. I regret that we are not allowed to discuss the exam questions (of course after the dead line) for a better understanding.,4
38065,Good introduction with practice.,4
93750,This course is a good starting point for learning the bits and pieces of R. It shows you how to work with data in a fairly easy manner.The course is well explained and the exercises are challenging.,4
31290,"I Love this course, and I need more reviewing from you",4
34712,"I have learned a lot in this course. It is very nice, but I think that it would be nice if the students can communicate with the teacher directly, because sometimes there are some comments or questions and it is only read it by the group.",4
18444,This course is Amazing! I learned a lotabout webpages and how to style them. It only fails because we don't see an example of javascript on a real webpage.,4
65565,Both teachers are so passionate about what they are talking that is always a pleasure watching the videos and learning a lot about Fashion and Luxury!,4
87136,Nothing short of being excellent!,4
17107,Great course. Like the slides and the way it structured. It could be broader if not so Google centralized and more international. For example in Russia there is Yandex.ru (ya.com) which controls 75% of search market and in China there is Baidu and others and no Google and Facebook. These questions is not highlighted in the course.,4
89927,Grate class for any beginner with no programming background or Python knowledge. Helped me to understand key basic concepts. Will be nice if you guys provide more exercises to practice and tougher questions.,4
95186,"Overall this was a great class. The programming assignments were the most valuable part of the course for me and were good practice for wrangling data with pandas. I did find some of the assignments asked questions in a way that were confusing and it was difficult to debug the answer based on the automatic grader. However, I'm looking forward to when the rest of the specialization is available, as this looks like a good track!",4
4844,I found this course to be very interesting and informing.,4
780,"While the course was overall well developed, there are certain language challenges to overcome especially with understanding the wording of quizzes. I got a number of questions wrong simply because I could not understand the phrasing, and lack of explanations on quizzes makes for a lot of difficulty to evaluate progress. And I get the reason for not including answer explanations, at the same time I'm literally comparing answers to the module transcripts and could not possibly infer multiple choice answers based off how the topic was explained. I would suggest more definitive questions and reduce multiple choice questions or at least define the question in a more narrow, specified manner to minimize confusion. I'm taking this course for fun, I have an MBA and love strategy, so the topics are not new by any means, but if I can't understand what you're trying to say I would imagine non-business backgrounds would find the questions very difficult.",4
25173,It was a powerful guide for building and improving a resume.,4
28262,I learn a lot about graphic design and I'm eager to learn more,4
5173,"The course is really good.i was little bit familiar with statistics but after this course everything became clear in my mind and don,t have any confusion also .",4
42311,Great Course on the leadership behavior,4
66866,"Interesting, broad introduction to the field. Most of the lectures are easy enough to follow as someone with a psychology background.",4
80206,"Informative, basic, nuts and bolts information",4
87859,clear and crisp explanations of each topic,4
43837,"Really loved this class! I am a pre-med student and when I took this course I was studying for my MCAT exam. There are so many aspects to this course that cross over to the psychology section on the exam, however I do think that the most valuable information in this course is the practical application of how to specifically refine and improve my focus in learning and my personal study sessions. Dr. Barbara Oakley is definitely",4
100490,This course was basic yet covered many important elements for research design. It helped me to better understand the parts of design. The readings were relevant and the assignments were thorough enough to solidify main ideas. The videos were interesting. I would recommend the course for beginners.,4
55866,"I would give 4.5 stars if I could. First, the positives: I got a great overview of many machine learning topics and learned a lot in general, the professor is excellent, and the programming assignments have plenty of resources to expand your knowledge beyond the core requirements. However, in later weeks, as the assignments grew more complex, I became a monkey. In the earlier weeks there was a focus on the fundamentals, which while very frustrating, are necessary to cement your skills. Later weeks failed to keep this up and emphasized increasingly isolated problems where it wasn't necessary to understand the big picture, and you can succeed (still with frustration) using blind guessing and transposing matrices. The problem with this method is that real life does not always have an assured solution. That said, if you are self motivated, there are plenty of resources to address this gap, and if you want to learn machine learning for its own sake (and not just to get a certificate), I strongly recommend you take this course.",4
85052,"Nice course with comprehensive lectures, maybe a bit too easy but I learned a few things, so thank you very much!",4
75927,"Quite python basics.If you have learned other programming languages,you just need 2-5 hours to complete this course.Anyway,it is a good start for learning python.",4
59650,"Very nice, the only bad thing is that the instructor uses Octave/Matlab, It would have been nice if he have used Python instead.",4
12727,"Great information, great teacher, greater visual presentation. Disclaimer: I only took the first week.",4
94530,I expected more in Binomial Regression and Poisson regression,4
13585,very theoritical,4
13539,The course material was good and the understanding of the subject was satisfactory . :)Thank You and keep us updated .,4
29145,"Great information, slower to get to the real goals of the course until the second half of it.",4
7083,Very Good! Thanks for everything. See you.,4
71048,Extremely hard. I took my time with this course. Please have some experience with Scala before you take this class. This is not an introduction to Scala. For all you that say it is....you are pissed off and bitter. This class is for those who have experience in the language.,4
104741,"It was easy to understand, it has nice rityhm to follow",4
89198,Great content,4
56530,Very good course over all. If you know a bit about linear algebra the course can get a little borring some times...,4
91967,Touches on a lot of subjects. Each having its own complexity. I'd have loved of the concepts are covered in a little more depth.,4
5408,"The contents of the course are great and prof. Impey is a great communicator. The course is easy to follow, the final chapters on galaxies and cosmology are a bit more difficult but that is due to the nature of the subject and I applaud that the prof does not ""dumb it down"" or brushes over such difficult ans speculative subjects. I minor nuisance for me were the frequent songs and funny videos interspersed in the course content. It would have been better if they were separate from the main videos or otherwise could be easily skipped by people who don't have a lot of time. overall a great course!",4
83969,"Excellent, am becoming a more confident programmerLoved this course",4
94372,"First and foremost I'm so thankful for the exposure to so much material in such a condensed schedule. Very good class. Even though I had to muscle my way through it.I think the class could be improved with one additional discussion thread for the project.A guide similar to the ones created for Inferential Statistics and Regression would also have been very helpful.I benefited immensely from reading parts of the book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"" while taking this course.",4
72311,This course increased my thirst of learning in a new field.,4
50703,"I took this course a while back . It is pretty good. Covers basics, gives you examples, etc",4
99150,"Its an excellent course for a beginner to understand the Wind energy. Emphasis on basics of engineering helps to build & connect to broader understanding during this course. Would have liked to see a bit more explanation on few other aspects of WTG like Foundation, Tower structure, Gearbox, Safety systems etc. But thoroughly enjoyed this course.",4
1066,"Needs some means of feedback. Several times I felt sure that a question was wrong, but there's nothing to be done about it. Additionally, it would be nice if, after completing (and passing) a test, you could see what you did wrong and how the answer should have been determined.",4
93927,Just started today and have already learned a lot!!! Looking forward to next weeks lesson!!!,4
84374,The syllabus is too easy for a beginner also.Make it slightly challenging.,4
97332,Valuable not only for those who wanna start without VC's,4
102203,"The course focused too much on careers in SEO, and the required personality traits. SEO is part of many other career streams, so spending 1/2 of the course on SEO as a career was a complete waste of time for me. Did enjoy the historical walk-through of the GA algorithm, and the point to refocus on. Thanks",4
93968,fantastic course help u learning how to learn,4
33481,Such a nice course. Very good for an introductory course,4
24943,Good enough for a fast start.,4
49328,Good for new Korean learners to start from zero.,4
41196,A fun course with a good instructor. it introduces a simple process for brainstorming ideas.,4
73087,Very basic course. I enjoyed the lessons and the assignments. Gave some fundamental view and perspective about the field of typography.,4
89458,"Good Course. It should be complemented with reading of Neuman, Quantitative and Qualitative Methods in Social Science, which gives a far better overview of the contents of week 1 and 2 (insights into the scientific method). Nevertheless the rest of the weeks are very good and should provide a great framework of Quantitative methods for a undergraduate student, who can then complement this framework with some detailed additional readings, if it is of his liking. All in all, I really ended my fisrt college semester with an excellent knowledge in quantitative methods, for which I have to thank, in part to Miss Scholten for this wonderful course.",4
50708,"Useful course aimed mostly for beginners, but quiz questions are formulated with ambiguity making it frustrating to answer since you end up reading between lines trying to avoid traps instead of putting your mind to work towards using the knowledge given by the course",4
95495,"Although the tests can be a bit fiddly, this is a great course if you already have a bit of background with Python and/or data cleaning. Lecture and tutorial videos are lean and information-dense.",4
52533,Very good overview over a topical area - more in-depth exercises for testing one's own understanding might have been helpful,4
69074,Very didatic approach to machine learning. Easy access and still powerful technique to understand how it works.,4
91998,too simple TT,4
92437,"Good start on Python and some sequence analysis, looking forward to start programming more",4
40602,good course with interesting speakers and insights. Research-based with practical applications.,4
87613,overall covered a lot of interesting material - hope to see more classes that dive deeper into webscraping and not just getting at the basics,4
51911,"The course is perfect . If my friends need this kind of classes , I would recommend this one. But not efriends around me",4
98577,Excellent course teaching the fundamentals of thermodynamics.,4
24741,Clearly explained concepts and relevant references and resources.,4
4349,So far i have found it useful. Most of the introduction elements are elementary but it gives you a chance to build up your knowledge and apply it as you go.,4
72891,too much theory,4
8110,"Very interesting and handy. I'm Spaniard, so most of the things are basic for me such as the use of onion and garlic in meals, and the use of street market for shopping vegetables. But the recipes were fantastic and since I'm a mother of a 1-year-old child, I will put on practice soon. Thank you!",4
22625,This course is amazingly interesting. All the course content are relevant and easy to catch up. Everyone should join this course to create basic knowledge of finance,4
98743,Great Course,4
44566,interesting and simple tricks that can apply to everyday life,4
20762,This is a great course. It accomplishes its objectives to give a basic understanding regarding the basics about Epidemiology.,4
77842,Excellent course! Everyone should take this course and try their hands on a great programming language -Python,4
72003,It's a nice course! It'd be better if more caption is available.,4
68459,homework could be more complicated,4
47686,Very informative course! Both the professors have wonderful teaching abilities!,4
68961,Provides a good overview of the machine learning branches. Makes sense to approach it as a black box and then take deep dives in later series.,4
90184,Damn good!! and bit difficult,4
3195,The tutor is exceptionally good. It included all the sources for documentation but I felt I learned more from by reading the Angularjs official documentation than from this course. Assignments covered a variety of concepts.,4
28093,"This is a great intro course for anybody new to the subject. I look forward to expanding my knowledge with the base of information provided here. I also really loved the assignments and the deadlines; I've been trying to learn the fundamentals on my own, but having the structure of this class really helped me to make progress.",4
38237,"Hi,I got promoted as a beta tester only 4 days ago, which was too short to review the whole course. So, here's my review for the first two weeks.The course is nice and easy to follow. It looks like beginner level. However, since it seems aimed at beginners, I think the teacher should put more emphasis on- good practices (i.e. when there are several ways to do something, always indicate which one is recommended).- accessibility for people with disabilities, which should be a priority when creating new websiteAlso, I think that 3 weeks is a bit too short. The first week should at least be split in two so that students get more time to practice HTML/CSS coding.Lastly, there should be many more practice quizzes and (why not?) optional projects.Thank you for having me as a beta tester.",4
79139,"it will be better if there is some form of text or readings that can be shared in the course.When speaking of the examples during the lecture, I wish there is a real video of the experience rather than just the prof speaking of it. I wish I could have my own understanding in responding to those experiences. However, overall I learnt a lot through out the courses, it is really easy to understand, and usually I watch the videos when I want to take a break from whatever I was doing.",4
24824,"You can get to know about basic points about RM, like user segments, forecasting and pricing.",4
19614,This course gave me a great insight into how the mind of my dyslexic son works and good hints to help him succeed in the classroom.,4
3802,overall a good course. Teaches you the basics of arduino and how to integrate c language with the arduino,4
26097,Course very good. I learned a lot about architecture and game design with Unity .,4
23384,"Interesting topic and very good informationNot enough content (my opinion)Tests where way to easy, I could take them all without first watching the videos, and my grade ist above 90%. The questions are (espacially in Week 3 and 4) easy to solve with logic and a basic intelligence. Please work on making it harder! :)",4
82112,Nice job of simplifying the content. Simple and clear examples provided removing all the code that is unrelated to the topic at hand! Well worth taking for those new and for those wanting to get a refresher on the topic.,4
35789,"This course was just what I was looking for, being a budding historical fiction writer myself. It made me authenticate that I was doing mostly everything right so far. I have three complete novels in my treasure trove and three as work in progress. Bringing in authentic authors of historical fiction gave me first hand tips, and precious insight into the experiences of real life writers just like me, who take true pleasure in what they do, and do best. I would indeed appreciate a sequel to this well put together course; the sooner the better! Congratulations, Professor Holsinger! Thank you, University of Virginia! P.S. I could do with a complimentary Certificate of Accomplishment, though.",4
33184,Great course..,4
13126,Got very good insights on the application of the various aspects of Game Theory in the real world scenario.,4
106635,Very good Basic strategy management concepts. Will help in clearing some doubts.,4
98725,Through this course I was given a lot of information on water management policies throughout history. Sometimes the practical applications were difficult to visualize in a real-world context although there were many case studies shown (maybe because being from the U.S. we have a less politically complex system). A strong emphasis was placed on international laws that are relevant today. If I end up working within the water sector in the U.S. I expect that this knowledge will help me put my work into a broader perspective and help me find innovative solutions to problems. The translation of the script from French to English needs more work. Sometimes it took me longer to understand concepts due to poor translation or spelling errors.,4
79317,Great first part with clear and vivid explanations. Later in the course a little too many referrals to the book.,4
67978,"Upon the first few views of the subject material, presented in the form of dramatized episodes, I was skeptical if this course was worth its time. I was pleasantly surprised once we moved into motivation in the 21st century, and the course only improved from there (though the multiple long videos in the financial crisis module felt redundant). A meaningful course as long as you can engage yourself with the material rather than rely on their sub-par assignments and quizzes to engage you. I also, did not participate in any discussions, but perhaps if I had this course would have been rated 5 stars.",4
86905,"Compared with last two courses, this course is a little more difficult to understand.",4
98416,"A great course to start. IT bridges between Design Thinking and Agile. I found that very valuable, especially for Product Owners who need to understand what ""Pre-Scrum"" activities are required/helpful in their role, i.e. it doesn't make sense to define what you want before you know what you need.Some of the videos have a bit of lengths, if you're already familiar with the topic. But that might be part of the didactics for beginners.The Quizzes sometimes seem to be a bit 'awkward' - i.e. maybe they aren't very obvious for non-native speakers while they are for native speakers? It's often littel details, or rather the tone of the sentence, that seems to make it the right answer.The access to templates etc. is great although they are available in the internet anyway if you know where to look.The skits remind me the TV distance learning for English in the 70ies in Germany. I find the funny but not as usefull as they could be. But I like the idea.",4
5852,"I found the course to have some really helpful approaches to solving algorithmic problems when test inputs are unknown. Great ""Toolbox"" for a programmer.",4
62731,"I think this course is interesting and informative. I have progressed into the second week, and the expositions of digital marketing techniques are interesting and fairly detailed. I would recommend this course to gain an understanding of traditional and newer advertising strategies employed by companies.",4
78229,"very good course, python had very much significance in today's world.Thank You all.",4
68957,Great course! I had to watch some of the videos over and over again for the material to really sink in but after I understood what's happening it was very enlightening. This course will really get you hooked into learning data science!,4
19050,It may be more helpful to students who are not taking the honors code if they had access to ready made programming codes to complete the stepik exercises as it is extremely taxing and not feasible to solve all problems by hand.Brilliantly structured and very effective learning method!I also felt that Gibbs sampling could have been explained further or more in detail.Thank you!,4
102164,"The course was awesome.. Truly, I have learned about the introduction of the web and the birth of search engines, followed by their progression and development through out the modern era. Thanks to the Team.",4

79741,"Presentation is clean and good. Exercises are totally guided, and don't actually cover the whole scope of the course.",4
22332,This is amazing course to clear your basic concept... Like it,4
47972,Very useful course! Helped me clarify some aspects I was stuck on. It will also enable me to help others.,4
59275,Andrew Ng walks you through some complex material in a way that makes it easy to grasp the basic notions. The assignments are very well documented and the code skeleton that's provided makes it easy to complete them (maybe a bit too easy - someone would have a rough awaking when having to code all this from scratch again as they apply it to their real jobs).,4
105251,"The contents were comprehensive, and the assignments helped reinforce the theory. By using pre-existing references to other works, they were tighter, which I think is useful to focus on the objectives set for a particular week. Some additional creative freedom would also have been interesting.",4
60413,Data Analysis and the technicalities of getting to the right results and presenting them in a meaningful way,4
75972,Wish they had more assignments to test you.,4
45743,Useful programme with helpful insights in learning.,4
69026,This was a fantastic course for someone both unfamiliar with machine learning algorithms and python.,4
89357,"This is a really good course, comprehensive and useful to anyone wanting to know about quant methods. It's pretty tough and you need to study, but if you finish it you'll definitely learn a lot.",4
24142,"This is a good intro course which introduce the Finite Element Method step by step, which suited me perfectly since I hardly coded in c++ nor did FEM before.Nevertheless, as a graduate student, the pace is very slow, and the outline and motivation unclear, which would likely have discouraged me if I did not review video in x2, and stuck to second week lectures and onward.I would advise to introduce more outline and motivation at the beginning of the week lecture to keep students motivated.Apart from that, I recommand the course !",4
47817,This course help me understanding the basic way to learn and enhance your ability to learn especially suitable with your way of learning and makes you know if your way of learning until now is suitable for you or not. Nice.,4
83353,"Python Data Structures is a good course and well thought out. There are plenty of resources to help the student, my only recommendation would be that the assignments moreso force the students to use the relevant concepts rather than allowing work arounds. I occasionally felt the homework could have been structured to more step by step steer me to use concepts from the most recent lesson.",4
62776,Generally quite good in reviewing a multitude of aspects. I did miss not having my responses evaluated even though I decided just to audit this course. On almost all occassions others courses let you evaluate your learning as you go so this was disappointing.I did purchase Bloom's book which I find easy to read and very complimentary to the course.,4
54559,"Good for beginner, but somehow too simple for further study.",4
96749,"It was simple yet useful, and the instructor is definitely a nice guy!",4

50825,very solid intro course.,4
44221,"Many handy tools to add to your mental library, and solid intake of neurological knowledge as well. 4/5 because I hoped that even broader spectrum of techniques would be shown, and pacing of the course was personally a little too slow.",4
16377,This course is very good especially for beginners getting started with SAS or python for data analytics. The lessons are very clear and easy to understand. Learnt a lot of valuable information and also enjoyed it.,4
62347,"I found this course really fascinating. The key concepts, academic insights, exercises and assignments; all contributed towards real world and practical learning experience.",4
105316,"A good course, its just a little bit too short based on the content it wants us to focus. The chapter on presenting our information is funny because the slides presented contain every anti-pattern that they want us to avoid. Apart from that, a great course.",4
9275,"Good course that covers some of the most fundamental concepts behind Calculus. Although the lecturer is quite ""in your face"", the lectures are well structured and well explained. The intro music at every lecture (every 3-5 minutes) is unnecessary and annoying.",4

66717,"A great course. I learned a new perspective about negotiation, now I'll continue to making my road. Thanks",4
94237,The quiz should be constructed in a way that depends less on the version of the libraries used. The rest of course was excellent.,4
13313,Excellent course. Very Helpful in understanding competitor analysis.,4
81874,Well presented content.It was a little bit weird for me to jump straight to jQuery and spending so little time on Javascript but it works out for the course. I would suggest a couple of more examples and explanation of general programming concepts with providing relevant pdf.Generally a very good and content-rich course.,4

83025,Very good course. It should contain more practical examples to make the material better to understand.,4
66812,This course is immensely helpful for any one who wants to get into the area of Digital Marketing. The lecture series along with the recommended course material gives a very good insight into the vast world of Digital Marketing. I am happy I find this course and could complete successfully as well.,4
64472,Good: i understand a lot of things.,4
19460,Thank you for this well prepared and presented course.the assignment were very useful to test and validate our understanding of the course materials. I also liked the opening question and the answer at the end.,4
22668,"It was a good course but there were things missing, such as exercises and more examples.",4
2614,Great training using a terrific dataset. Learned some best practices and frameworks too.,4
687,Good Course.,4
79207,"Very good course, interesting.",4
94915,"Very informative and cleared up a lot of questions I had about processes, agile, scrum, kanban and how they work together.",4
12019,"The course was really helpful.Considering the fact that I was not from security background, it went very smoothly",4
3751,Found it helpful.,4
596,"Good content but the Chinese translation is bad, which makes quiz quite obscure in meaning",4
102012,"Very interesting course, with many description but not enough examples that why I give only 4 stars not 5.",4
38127,"Basic web course and very well detailed. I could review basic concepts of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to continue in the specialisation series.",4
92581,Enjoyed the course!,4
49599,Very interesting introduction to IoT. Provides lot of context before programming actual IoT devices.,4
14632,Good Basic Course,4
1656,"Good professors but you will not learn a lot, since it is more or less an introduction for the other courses of the specialization. Good if is not used as standalone.",4
4417,"I missed some more content in certain areas of the course (i.e. histograms). Apart from that, great course and great explanations by Daniel Egger!",4
7669,"I love the teaching style that Maya provides. The diagrams are cute and engaging.A great course for those who are not used to eating healthy, and do not cook on a regular basis.For those who are already health conscious and enjoy cooking, this course may not provide you with much new information, but rather confirmed what I already knew and was taught as a child by your mother, or through learning how to cook healthy meals for yourself.",4
30380,"The course is quite informative and useful. However, I think the charge of 60e is too high since the skills introduced are both elementary and limited. 10e would be a proper price.",4
4598,"The syllabus needs a bit of update, as many new developments happened since this course was put together. Nonetheless, still very much relevant as an introduction to astrobiology.",4
14757,Good introduction.,4
98708,Pretty useful course,4
1774,"It was a great introductory course, and a comprehensive overview of different business metrics.",4
99964,"Very useful. Videos are short, so it's easy to complete it and don't require much time.",4
10862,"Very nice, quick overview. Formulation of equations in Biology leaves a bit to interpretation but this is a systemic issue. The guy is obviously highly proficient and comfortable with the subject matter never falters in his delivery. Assignments are all quizzes and the whole thing can be completed without undue pain.",4
63029,Very interesting,4
28791,"Very good, practical, just to the point, with lots of quotes and evidence on studies that suppport course affirmations. Really enjoyable!",4
104772,"Nice course, but need more detailed one for those new to statistics.",4
16580,"A very informative course in the sense that though its very basic but its the first time I got everything in a structured way. I am already a Infosec professional however my domain is not mobility. So mobility with security and its use business development is a phenomenal task. Hence, I guess its a very good course for this specialisation. I am not giving 5 stars as there is always scope for improvement. However, it may be taken as a five star course.Thanks to all the people who designed the course.",4
90958,I would only like this course better if it was longer and more in-depth. Excellent!,4
66532,"Nice information about Modern and contemporary art. General information, with good resources.",4
76188,"beautifully taught :) thank you Sir. Also, if there were more assignments it would have been even better.",4
9904,Good basic course hard to get lost but does require some follow through if things are unfamiliar,4
92110,"Good initial overview to the topic. Most code is actually provided to the student, preventing deeper learning via trial & error. However, it is a tradeoff of making the course accessible to a large number of students versus being too challenging and preventing newcomers from enjoying the subject. Dr. Severance is excellent -- entertaining and clearly very knowledgable. For any novice programmers looking to understand how Python interacts with databases, this is the best place to start.",4
41276,"I enjoyed this course. Being new to stats, I feel I needed more practice and extra examples. A lot of extra work and self-study helped me grasp and pass this course.",4
68610,The course is very simple so far. Hope it's just because it's the first one in the specialization. Love the teaching style.,4
14109,"It was a little to easy and the quizzes were not really necessary. Questions like ""What courses are in the Data-Science Specialization?"" don't help to controll my learning progress. However for a first, introducing course it was okay. R Programming is way more interesting and challenging <3",4
100598,"Really enjoyed the course guys - thanks very much for investing the time required to offer this to the masses! The videos were great - brief, succinct lessons to discuss valuable, applicable tools for optimizing growth strategy.Cheers,",4
94318,"Of all the JHU Data Science specialization courses I've had, this was by far the most enjoyable. I really liked how the class was more in the style of 'here's some techniques, now do whatever you want on the project.' Prior courses are, and understandably so, more constrained in the assignments. It's not until here that the student really has the tools to be able to flex their analytical muscles, and it pays off.Also, of the three instructors, I am most favorable to Jeff Leek, who teaches this class. He communicates much clearer than Roger Peng or Brian Caffo. I find I learn more from his content than the others.Lastly, I will say that this class doesn't hold a torch to University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization. That's expected since this is one class and that's a whole series of classes. If you're hungry for more after this one, I highly recommend UWash's Machine Learning specialization.",4
77022,Excellent introduction to the Python language. Looking forward to apply what I have learnt.,4
48868,"This course was well designed and provided a good balance of lecture, knowledge checks and practical assignments. The feedback received from the Peer Reviews was helpful and the section on Negotiation was especially useful to me in my current position.",4
101180,I really enjoyed this course. There were ideas that really helped me defined my idea. I love the presentation. I would suggest breaking some of the longer modules into smaller parts. Add another Quiz on the third and 4th lesson. I do love this specialization. I am going to keep going.,4
90903,This is a good course with good support. But it still has a few teething problems.,4
20301,Its great that Cour,4
9724,"Lively, and more practial",4
48113,A very useful and intriguing course that explore the idea of learning. Every life long leaner can find this course helpful.,4
22409,"Great quality, learning, applications. Enathe language and tools expected after course completion.",4
33386,Great course! Overall probably a little too basic but definitely a good introduction.,4
47494,"Excellent course, a real eye opener to the basic understanding of learning",4
11663,"Excellent course. It helps you transition to C++ by understanding the reasons, not just a simple recipe.",4
86760,"I moved to the US a couple years ago and started my career from scratch in completely different sphere - Quality Assurance. I never supposed myself to be a technical person and felt uncomfortable with IT things. I have in my head the combination of tech terms and tools mixed up with huge gaps, this course helped me to systematize my knowledge and feel more confident and engaged with what I am doing. I completed 3/4 sessions and would rate the first two 5 stars, and probably give a little bit less, 4 stars, to the third one, only because sometimes I had to find on the Internet additional materials which were not covered by lecture and course materials to complete my assignments.",4
2269,"Very interesting course, better done when in an academic context and with an ongoing project to carry out the exercices for. If you don't have access to a university library, you will be very limited, but the course presents some alternatives for us professionals who are still interested in researching and documenting our work with a more scientific approach.",4
49798,"Really crisp content as introduction to world of IoT. MANET's, network layer sessions are very informative.",4
37177,Very good course.,4
67067,"This is a great course. Unlike Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, this course does not shy away from using real mathematics to explain the models being studied, and is all the better for it. Some of the explanations were a little mysterious to this student (e.g. how can you discuss sampling of restricted Boltzmann machines, which are essentially bipartite Ising models, without mentioning conditional probability?). However, Professor Hinton motivated everything so well that I always *wanted* to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the videos while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand. The programming assignments were also well-designed, so that I found myself forced to confront various aspects of the models and algorithms that I'd thought I'd understood the first time round but in fact had not. Thank you Professor Hinton.",4
76502,Too easy for my opinion,4
3020,"Organized like the ideal textbook, but I would have preferred that there be more practice problems on quizzes.",4
86154,"Decent course, need some work material to get a better grip on it!",4
70704,"Very crisp explanations. Treatment on polymorphism was very good. The only thing I did not like was that we were forced to cast a few times during our assignments, and usually this is not a good practice to be taught to someone.",4
21560,"This topic is excellent, I learnt lots of things from this course. Thanks to Proffers Peter to provide such good session.",4
2886,I think tests should be little more difficult,4
85804,"I think should be more lessons with less time, like the first modules.But the content is great!",4
97101,"Interesting, gave an unique approach to innovation and creativity.",4
29671,"I learnt a lot in this course that surprised me. I went from being terrified of essays to managing to write one a few pages long. Thank you. My biggest issue and why I didn't give it 5 stars if the grading is via peer review and this meant a long wait and lots of begging PLUS getting only one word reviews such as great. Not very helpful. I would like a person who is experienced in essay writing to do a review, but I do understand that, by sheer numbers of students, this would be non viable.",4
496,"The course was enjoyable for the most partand I increased my skill level. The videos, for the most part, were good. However, consider revising some of the one for Fusion to include demonstrations for the sweep, loft, and revolve tools in the Sculpt mode if they are to be included in assignments. These were not as intuitive as the others and required reliance on videos found on Autodesk as well as Youtube. Additionally, it would be helpful to slow the pace in illustrating ""how-to"" in the videos. There seemed to be steps omitted and I found it difficult at times to reconstruct all the steps. Finally, I noticed that staff/mentor help was not readily available for weeks, when participants posted queries in the forum.",4
28302,I think this course was great- it really got you exploring and experimenting. I do think that there should be more REQUIRED briefs. Two of the modules out of the four were quiz's which was a little disappointing. I also think there needs to be some online help. In the last brief there was a large discussion as a lot of students were confused about the task and nobody stepped up to help clear the air- this is the reason I gave this course 4 not 5 stars.,4
88489,"Great course! Sometimes it got a little bit boring and in the next moment the important information was too fast spoken to me (no native speaker) - but i enjoyed, that some complicated sentecnes have always been repeated in more simple language without too many foreign words! I also enjoyed the videos with the false/correct methods which were shown. Dr. Everly has a good voice and pronaunciation, so that i was able to listen. also great, that the quiz has no timelimit, like questions need to be anwered in 3 minutes, because i had to translate a view words into german to understand the questions and this needs time. thanks!",4
75918,Good introductory course. Probably add more (optional) exercises to help get practise.,4
79904,This course is very helpful. Makes me think of the possible constraints and how to resolve.,4
5880,"The content covered in this course is great. However, I hope there was a more efficient way to communicate with student. I hope there is a way to bring student together like a group chat function in the coursera app. So, people who want to be more committed can communicate more often and effcient.",4
105835,A great overview of a very complicated topic. Dr. Sachs does a great job presenting the information in easily digestible bits but still keeps it interesting.,4
96084,I found the material was good and the instructor was engaging. I appreciate that he tries to make learning hands on. Overall I found this a great introduction to Bootstrap. My only criticism is that at times I felt like I was only copying and pasting code rather than really learning the material. I ended up copying and pasting plenty of tags that are never really mentioned or explained.,4
89212,I thing it is necessary more information about handlebars.,4
47636,"I am already mouthwatering on what I will learn from this course. After watching the preview, I am confident on the quality of this course.",4
17235,I really like tasks and quizzes in the course. It makes in much more transparent. Thanks!,4
40434,"It is excellent, although 4 stars as I, as an infectious disease physician now, have less capability of assessing surgical part.",4
17373,I wish for more hands on work.,4
98981,"Great course. It open ed up my eyes to how simple it can be to generate a workable MVC web application without having to dive too deep into the working of the application,",4
38045,I loved this course. The only thing that could have made this better was more days for the deadlines.,4
105842,Very enlightening course thus far. The format is perfect,4
86952,Really a nice course! Dr. Chuck makes it easy to use Python to access web data! Thanks a lot!,4
77054,Incredible...,4
89897,"Ideal to get the basic python concepts, the grade exercises are fair with a proper skill level.",4
90870,"I found the course fun and engaging. I studied Physics a while ago; without this I think I would have had problems following the contents.I wish the first two programming assignments were combined, so that there was room for another assignment for implementing a full 3d controller that doesn't assume a linearization around the hover state.",4
4108,"It's a good course. Funny and intelligent, but it can be a little more challenging.",4
96401,"A very good course, working on one large website project. The lecturer talks a little slowly, but makes things very clear. Some of the review criteria for the assignments are wrong for example ""div-xs-12"" should have been ""col-sm-12"" , which makes fair grading difficult at times.",4
90441,Very good course. Would love to get to see examples of some advanced usage of knitr in developing presentations and complex reports.,4
54181,Please add the random forest algorithm.,4
11126,"Although still very good and insightful, I found that this MOOC was the less strong of the specialization and the three first MOOCs were the ones that taught me the most. Especially, I found this one was missing a peer-to-peer assignment. In MOOC 4 we were told to write various tweets corresponding to different parts of the Maslow's hierarchy. Logically, I assumed that the next peer-to-peer assignment will be about the results and how to interpret them and where to go from there. But no. Furthermore, we could have been asked to prepare a Business Plan to defend the project as taught in this MOOC. No again.",4
22708,"Well done overall. I would have liked a little more detail with some of the formulas mentioned, but overall I felt like I learned quite a bit.",4
46469,Quite informative. All videos are short enough to keep you focused. Key ideas are helpful and practical.,4
2725,"Great Course..! but include 10000 of practice test like 3 hour of practice tests because test will prepare you and define what is your level , include job focus to get job , include hackathons .Include direct apply to companies from this course.",4
104804,The course is useful and essential not only for those studying statistics but machine learning,4
95857,This is a great source for new ideas in how to built fine products.,4
14139,The course is a nice set up for tools and environments that you need for other data science courses.,4
22592,the course. It has advanced my knowledge and understanding of basic financial concepts which greatly helped me in my career.,4
12036,Testing environment for coding assignments was difficult to use to troubleshoot programs for errors.,4
102520,"Very enlightening, I would recommend this course.",4
36864,Good review of the history.,4
16510,Wonderful course and the teacher is very well prepared.,4
35892,I learnt quite alot about design luminaries. Would prefer if it was truely global but still a very interesting course,4
75975,"The course is great so far. However, i'm facing technical issues with the auto-grader and with using the phython tool online.",4
11087,The theories and the cases give me deeply impression. I think the course is very useful and grounded.,4
104664,"some lectures were very american-reality-oriented, the terms were very difficult to understand, although the information provided was very useful Thanks!",4
22739,The lectures are quick and concise. The lecturer speaks very clearly and gives great examples that illustrate the concepts well.,4
82110,Really fun and informative course. Definitely recommend.,4
106268,Thank you for introducing me to so much Web 2.0 Tools.,4
32810,Structured course.,4
5006,"Nice overview, gives a good appreciation for changes happening in the Arctic. Sometimes the lecture material is a bit dry and repetitive/slow.",4
48040,Excellent course - I have been using the pomodoro and the memory techniques. I sure could have used this class 30 years ago!,4
13915,Gave me a good introduction to basic Git and GitHub operations,4
9199,I absolutely love this course. The only thing that I would suggest is going into the trapezoid and Simpson's rule when evaluating areas under the curve.,4
21856,The course material is ok - it would really need a book like the other courses have. It is much easier to check something from a book than slides/video when doing the assignments etc. .,4
79504,"MUY BUENA HERRAMIENTA, ME PARECE ESENCIAL, MUY CLARA PARA SER ENTENDIDA POR CUALQUIER PERSONA",4
34438,I do not want to pay for quizes while learning.,4
97462,Teacher is a little harder to follow and less coherent than others in the specialisation. Still good.,4
8131,"Couple things I didn't agree with, but for the audience in mind I think it's very solid and has a wonderful introduction to child nutrition or just to grasp nutrition in general.",4
75171,This is a good course to start on Python for beginner.,4
104882,"Great course, could use some review though. Still give it a big thumbs up!",4
34145,To the point and informative,4
104829,GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF USING STATISTIC TEST IN R. HOPE TO ADD MORE MATERIAL,4
10487,"Cloud Computing and CDN courses were perfect. However, Big Data details was not very clear to me, the general idea was clear though.",4
12043,"Comprehensive and interesting course, covering BitCoin related topics in an easy to comprehend way.One thing that can be improved are programming assignements - it would be much easier if there would be project (Eclipse, IntelliJ, maven, ...) and unit tests provided.",4
13642,"The device of giving feedback has to simplistic, given the scope of the audience, but it's difficult to get any real value from it as far as future revisions. There should be a free write section that's required for someone to respond to the story organically as well as the specific, ""Did the writer do this?""",4
59252,Octave is so ridicules! It is better to be more practical and have a connection to real world applications.,4
46188,"Excellent way to revisit/rethink what it is to learn and how best to go about it. While unquestionably a boon to students, as an adult (past middle age), I took away many important and unexpected tips, techniques, and perspectives. Although I personally had little direct use for the section on Testing, it was still interesting—and I certainly wish I'd known that material when I was a student. One thing I would have liked to have addressed is how to set up and use self-testing to assist with day-to-day, non-student procedures and learning situations. Both faculty members were engaging and inspired confidence.",4
58892,Very interesting course!!!,5
28211,"wonderful course, very helpful with basic knowledge of graphic design usage of elements and forms and terminologies. Thank you, the videos were very helpful and very insightful and easy to follow. I'd so love to carry on taking more courses that can help broaden my knowledge",5
33193,Easy to understand and great for a beginner.,5
2563,"One of the best courses on Coursera: the content covers not just the usage of Tableau but also the objectives heading into using Tableau as well as the presentation of the results one gets from Tableau.

95160,Good intro to Pandas and assignments are well designed,5
94441,Love the whole course approach on the importance of linear models and how one should interpret them to get a better grasp of the data one possesses - one should definitely take the statistical inference course before attempting this course beforehand.,5
82934,Great course as well as the whole specialization. I recommend it to anyone interested in investing.,5
16961,Very interesting and informative. THANK YOU.,5
70608,Very helpful introduction to OOP course,5
84749,Great course. the teacher makes python really easy to understand and also speaks in a way that is easy for foreign people to understand as well.,5

52609,"Excellent course, i feel my skill has been grow up",5
63105,"Great course. I've mistakenly thought of HR job as a much simpler and bureaucratic than it really is. The course is full of interesting insights. I particularly enjoyed systematic, modelling approach. Assumptions on which models are based are clearly outlined and looked at from a critical perspective.

35571,Great course. Very well explained and really helped me understand the concepts of the three financial statements explained in the course. The reading material is very informative.,5
57807,By far the best MOOC on Machine Learning. Teaches the fundamental of the most important Machine Learning algorithms.,5
29051,"Wonderful course, wonderful speaker!",5
72534,"Nice explanation of concepts, and very helpful with getting started on the programming assignments. The algorithms are explained well in pseudo code, and the instructor does a good job at explaining why they work the way they do. The math is not very challenging, so I never felt frustrated.I only wish there was not such an emphasis on Graphlab. Although they do allow you to use other methods to finish the assignments, it feels as though more attention is given to explaining how Graphlab works instead of standard, free python libraries. I understand that they're trying to push a product, but I don't want to pay for something I'll only be using for a few courses. More attention should be given to sklearn.",5
59994,This is one of the best courses available over the internet. The course strikes right balance by not going into complex statistical concepts. It provides right amount intuition,5
35111,A clear and comprehensive introduction to guitare.,5

12958,An awesome course,5
106780,"Wonderful course!!! I got so much from the lectures, interviews, and exercise. I found the course very informative with valuable tips. I am new to the writing world and am excited to embark in the journey. This course helped pave the way in what to expect. Thank-you so much for the course!!!",5
85112,"Great Course for beginners, without any programming knowledge.I am suggesting to take this course before you will do any other courses. This course helped me to learn on other python courses, which were overestimated as ""for beginners"" but needed already some programming knowledge. In this course all assignments are based on learned material (based on lecture). I am glad that I took this course first.",5

45651,"Hello:I'm Keith Grimes and I just completed your course. I really enjoyed the course and feel that I've learned quite a bit about learning. I enrolled in the course simply because I felt it was time to take my love of ""the idea of learning"" and turn it into ""the practice of actually learning something.""What I loved most about the course was Barbara Oakley herself and her inspiring story. I graduated from Oakland University with a bachelors degree in English. During those undergrad days, I often experienced the Impostor Syndrome. Discovering that there was an actual name for what I often felt, combined with the struggle to learn that Dr. Oakley experienced in her younger years, really connected with me. Thank you for sharing.One other note... I recently had the opportunity to share many of these ideas and concepts with my son who is a sophomore at Michigan State University. As Dr. Sejnowski mentioned in the final video, the measure of really knowing if you've learned something is to teach it to someone else. Sharing what I learned with my son in order to help him along his journey as a student, was an invaluable experience.Thanks again for offering this course.Keith D. Grimeshttps://www.linkedin.com/in/keithdgrimes",5

One of the best features was his commentary on the intuition behind why these methods work. Since he came up with a number of these ideas himself (or was part of the team that did) he has a unique insight into how you can think about a problem to motivate a possibly fruitful approach. The other aspect of the course that I liked best was Hinton's copious use of real-world examples and feedback about which methods worked well on certain problems and why.

55157,"A fantastic opportunity to get a global overview of one the most exciting topics of data science.Lectures by Mr Andrew Ng are well structured, perfectly declined in both illustrating the need behind each development and in rigorously explaining its logic. He drives you through a step by step path and always helps in understanding the overall context with clear examples. Each video is stopped now and by a not graded quiz aimed to check you are perfectly in line with the concepts. Grades are obtained through the questionnaires (five questions each time, you need to get no less than four correct answers out of them) and a programming exercise in Octave/Matlab. Especially in order to well deal the programming exercises, the discussion forum and the kind availability of the course mentors are a great resource!In conclusion a seriously challenging course, that will take lot of your time but it's definitely worth!

65674,"I loved this course.I followed this course to prepare myself for teaching a similar course at the HZ University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands.This MOOC suits me perfectly to flip the classroom. Students study the videos offered by professor Page before they come to class. In class, I organize workshops that take about three hours during which the models are discussed and applied in groups of up to four students. Having a big classroom available with whiteboards all around the walls is a big plus. Standing really makes people's mind moving.At the end of each workshop, students have to do an assignment that closely relates to the topics that arose during the workshop. Together, all these assignments make up the portfolio wherein students keep track of their learning process and reflect on their learning experience.I wish everybody a happy thoughtful day,Frank PeetersSenior Lecturer at the HZ University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlandsfrank.peeters@hz.nl",5

These courses are the first courses where I really got a lot of knowledge. Especially because of assignments. All lectors are very good in explanation of the material and tell many additional useful things. These courses are the really good base, after which you can open the books related to algorithms and read more details if you needed.I am definitely going to complete the whole specialization!The only thing which was not convenient for me is that both courses Algorithmic Toolbox and Data Structures are started at the same time. It was difficult to find out the time for both courses and spend enough time to solve all assignments instead of only enough for passing.Anyway, now I am started the second iteration of the course and I am going to solve all assignments which I skipped.Big thanks to Daniel, Alex, Pavel, Neil and Mike!Regards,Sergey",5

Dr. Whiteman's approach to teaching the course really helped me a lot to understand the behavior of materials in both the linear elastic and plastic regions. Mohr's Circles was a mystery for me, for some strange reason, but Dr. Whiteman really opened the door for me in this course.

46707,"Really useful course. It helps me review my works and study.I come from Taiwan, currently as a MBA student studying in the UK.As a non English native speaker, it is really stressful to learn new things in academic level in a foreign language. I used to force myself study for a very long time without a break, but the results were not good as I expected. I blamed this to my language barrier, I thought the difference between the other successful peers is I couldn't have an the chance as the others who had better educational environment and leant English on the early stage.This class lets me understand the biggest challenge of my learning is procrastination. Hopefully, procrastination is nothing about being stupid or should feel shame about, it is a natural metal mechanism of our brain avoiding unpleasure things. And it can be overcome by methods and practices. Pomodoro Technique really helps my memory and extends the time I keep concentrate on one thing. With the practice my brain works more efficient and it brings better result.I recommend this course for the other who is struling with the barrier on learning and who does not have confident for himself/ herself on working and leaning.

82339,"The most valuable course in the specialization by far. The first two were pretty good too, but kind of too easy for me.",5
56811,"Professor Ng is a great teacher, his course is both challenging and satisfying. The exercises require you to take one step beyond the lecture -- not just parrot back the transcript -- you have to think about the implications of what you've just studied. Yet Ng's presentations are lucid and informative and that next step is obvious, once you think about it.My greatest challenge is that, although I have been programming for decades, I've only dabbled in a functional language like Octave and my last math class dates back to the 70s. However, the math requirements are not onerous and I'm struggling through the Octave assignments with some success.Although the course is 11 weeks there are more than 16 lectures as some weeks have two complete sets of lectures PLUS there are assignments every week that take a few hours to complete. So while there is a little more work in this course than in other Coursera offerings there is great value for the money and time spent.If you're interested in Machine Learning this course is a great place to start.",5

104526,"I must confess I've tried to complete other courses before but due to time constraints and other responsibilities I've failed miserably. But this time thanks to the fact I can study this on my own pace, I'm no longer having a clash between my job and the courses I want to study, which in turn fills me with excitement and appreciation for this course. Personally, I have a deep interest in the field of religion (spirituality, theology, comparative religions, etc) which I think it is fascinating. That's why I decided to enroll in this course and give it my best. I'm learning so much thanks to the awesome lectures the professors are given and the material it is provided. I watch the lectures, I take tons of notes and I do some extra research as well. I'm just about to finish unit 1 and looking forward to starting unit 2.I want to thank Coursera from the bottom of my heart for making this course available for free so I can have access to this material. The knowledge I'm getting here is helping me to sharpen my focus on what to study next.I hope more courses on religion (from an academic perspective) are offered in the future so I can learn even more.

36165,"This course was highly enjoyable. I would like to thank Dr. Shiller for a great course presentation. Professor Shiller presents the material on Financial Markets from a very interesting historical perspective that gives a human personality to the world of finance. It is open enough for someone that has no background in finance but also gives treatment to some mathematical models that students who know the basics may also benefit from. It certainly taught me a lot about how financial markets work and the rationale behind how the industry has developed the way it has along with the regulation around it. I would suggest adding another lecture video on crowdfunding, JOBS Act, fintech etc. in the final week which will talk about some of the developments in the world of finance which are very relevant today. It will also tie in nicely with the concept of 'democratization of finance' how we all can play a role in the finance industry. Highly recommended and well done!Regards, Zeeshan Shaikh",5

13537,"I liked this course alot.If you are a student and come from the previous course, you may only read the cons, since this course has the same spirit as the previous.Pros:1. The lectures contain quite a good material which is somehow difficult and they made me to pay attention. The lectures are based on dasgupta's book and MIT course book.2. There are links to additional materials, I found the dijkstra's book and MIT course book, so I was able to gain extra information for topics which interested me.Also slides are very useful3. The forum! This course has a life forum where you can find help or share your ideas.4. The teaching stuff! They are answering student questions and taking part in discussionsCons:Having compared this course with the previous one from the set, this course suffers from luck of interesting problems. The previous course has more than ~25 problems and for each module it has advanced problems,even more they added extra problems during the course running.This course has ~12 problems and only one advanced for the whole course!. Only this advanced problem made me take a piece of paper and a pen and draw trees, and play with toy examples. Only for this problem I wrote a stress test. That is the most fun for me of studying!If this course didn't have this advanced problem, I would barely give it 3 stars.P.S.Theaching stuff, please conider to add extra problems, the first course is awesome and it is way too good. This course is good, but it think you may develop it not only the first one. Otherwise students may get dissapointed if they come from the previous course.I hoped that you would have added extra problems, so I slowed down, my expectation didnt come true :(",5

44460,"This course ought to be given in Freshman year of High School and again in Freshman Year of College. Dr. Oakley is a wonderful conduit for this information. In week 4 the ADD brain is discussed with examples of what the world considers brilliant men. Amazing to learn why my learning as well as my daughter's has a ""delay"". I noticed her brain development when she was a baby. Day after day I'd try and teach her a new word or sign language or body shape in play. Days later after I thought okay, I'll wait and try something new, she'd do the thing I was teaching her days before. I did not understand this at all. For me now, I see how and why when information comes into my mind, it scatters and then days later, I feel a knowledge chunk forming. wow. This is something I wish I knew many years before. But it is good now that I learned so much about learning and how to feel positive about how best to use what I have to learn new things. Great course. I believe everyone should be required to take this course early in life... and then refresher later on.",5
86708,Every course taught by dr Chuck is a new quality. Substance of the course is little more demanding than previous 2 courses but paradoxically I had a feeling that new topics were taught without going into details... which paradoxically is good for the course.

I enjoyed all Paleo MOOCs given their very interesting content and outstanding presentation, but I must say that Early Vertebrate Evolution was far the best one, in my opinion. It is also true to say that all University of Alberta MOOCs, as usual, provided first class lecture notes. I would like to thank all the personnel involved in developing and making available this amazing tool for propagating science and knowledge. And I would like to suggest standardizing the measuring unit system throughout all courses, because there is an interchangeable use of either imperial or metric, and since most of the world uses metric system, that could be a good way to go.",5

I wasn't game to try the quizzes until I had downloaded the book on my iPad and read chapter six, glad I did and will use this as my weekly process.Enjoying this course very much. Week 2 quizzes were more testing, took three attempts at both quiz 3 and quiz 4 even though I passed on first attempt: 4 out of 6 / 4 out of 6; 4 out of 6 / 4 out of 6; 5 out of 6 / 6 out of 6. I like the dialogue format and that the language style is in modern conversational English. Socrates guy is hard to please, but he still forces us to think after 2,000 years. Pity the Greeks don't have him around today, their economy might be in better shape. The dentist at our local shopping centre is called Socrates but I don't believe they are related.",5

I wasted days on small errors that would not let my code run.

You draw a clock and must put in the time mentioned plus three words. Frankly, I was annoyed as I was a former teacher, had to drive, park, and use a ticket machine to visit the doctor. I was even more annoyed when I asked him if he could give me a stent test and he asked me how I knew about such things. People in the eighties are very sensitive about their mental abilities.Thank you for a nice experience!Joyce Spier",5

The Matlab programming assignments have been well thought out to incrementally step the student up through the different capabilities.'Select All that Apply' quiz questions will likely drive you crazy as there is no feedback on no feedback on failed questions to understand where your mistake(s) was/were which means you spend hours more pouring over the videos/notes to try and better understand possible options for a subsequent attempt.,5

As a Linguistics and Literature student, I felt that they found what was a very nice way to spread this knowledge and, in my case, a more concise discipline in which I could refresh my memory for somethings but also get to know new informations and different points of view and, at last, as an observer from Brazil, to compare a little how these things are discussed here from there. Thank you very much for the hard work and the entousiasm!",5

Each module gives important stepping stones for the students both to understand and to get practical skills to use the material after the course. For me it was an extra bonus to learn about teh Rails API in the 4th week of the course. I will surely need that in the future. All assignments include very thorough guidance on how you can check your own work one step at a time all the way through. In fact I have never before attended a course where so much effort had been but into that part by the teachers. Much praise for that. The graded assignments were hard. I had to put in a quite considerable effort in each of them, especially week 3. Much more work than I had anticipated.

This course is a particularly good option for individuals who have seen some amount of calculus and algebra but haven't used those methods in a long while and need to review. Thorough, easy-to-understand material.I would suggest to the course facilitators that they develop the provided lecture notes -- already a useful tool -- into a full-fledged text. I'm not suggesting something much longer than what they already have, but simply taking that document and adding a bit more rich content. While the notes are useful for more carefully studying the math being done in the lectures, even a bit of effort putting some pedagogy into the notes and combining them into a single document (which I did for the sake of printing) would create a hugely valuable resource.",5
